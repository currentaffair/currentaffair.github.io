        Rising Global Inequality

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Rising global inequality has become one of the most significant issues in today’s world, as the wealth gap between billionaires and the rest of the population continues to widen. A recent report from Oxfam International titled “Takers Not Makers: The Unjust Poverty and Unearned Wealth of Colonialism” highlights this issue, emphasizing how historical colonialism has played a pivotal role in exacerbating the wealth divide.</p>
<h3>Why in the News?</h3>
<p>The Oxfam report sheds light on the growing wealth of billionaires, revealing that their fortunes have grown faster than ever before. Meanwhile, poverty continues to plague billions globally, especially in regions affected by colonial exploitation.</p>
<h2>Key Highlights from Oxfam’s Report</h2>
<h3>Billionaire Wealth Growth</h3>
<p>In 2024, billionaire wealth increased by USD 2 trillion, with 204 new billionaires. This wealth grew three times faster than in 2023, with each billionaire's fortune growing by USD 2 million daily. The gap between the ultra-wealthy and the rest of the world continues to widen, exacerbating social and economic disparities.</p>
<h3>Rising Inequality</h3>
<p>The global wealth divide has reached alarming levels. The richest 1% now control 45% of the world’s wealth, while over 3.6 billion people survive on less than USD 6.85 per day. Extreme poverty affects 1 in 10 women worldwide, further highlighting the gendered impact of inequality. In 1820, the wealth of the richest 10% was 18 times greater than that of the poorest 50%, but by 2020, this gap had increased to 38 times.</p>
<h3>Colonial Legacy and Power Imbalances</h3>
<p>Historical colonialism has left a lasting imprint on global inequality, with the wealthiest countries reaping the benefits of colonial exploitation. The Global South continues to face the consequences, including weak governance, conflict, and economic dependency. Colonial powers, such as the UK, extracted enormous wealth from colonies like India, contributing to the present global economic imbalance.</p>
<h3>Inheritance and Wealth Concentration</h3>
<p>For the first time, more billionaires were created through inheritance than through entrepreneurship. This growing concentration of wealth has been further driven by cronyism and monopolies, making it difficult for ordinary citizens to break free from poverty.</p>
<h2>What is Global Inequality?</h2>
<p>Global inequality refers to the unequal distribution of wealth, resources, and opportunities worldwide. While there have been some improvements, particularly with the economic growth of emerging economies, income inequality within and between countries remains a significant challenge. Income disparities have worsened in many nations, with the richest gaining disproportionately from global economic growth.</p>
<h3>Income Inequality Between Countries</h3>
<p>While income inequality between countries has decreased over the past few decades, thanks to the economic rise of nations like China and India, substantial gaps remain. For instance, the average income in North America is 16 times higher than in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<h3>Income Inequality Within Countries</h3>
<p>Income inequality within countries has worsened in recent years. A significant portion of the global population resides in nations where inequality has increased. Social factors such as gender, race, and ethnicity contribute to these disparities, with women and marginalized communities facing disproportionate economic challenges.</p>
<h3>Drivers of Inequality</h3>
<p>The main drivers of global inequality include economic growth (or lack thereof), discriminatory social structures, and the unequal distribution of resources. Regressive tax policies, crony capitalism, and unequal access to education and healthcare contribute to the perpetuation of inequality.</p>
<h2>Impact of Inequality</h2>
<p>High levels of inequality hinder social mobility, economic development, and access to essential services. Inequality contributes to a decline in human rights, healthcare, and education, which exacerbates poverty and social unrest. In addition, inequality fuels the rise of nationalism and populism, as people seek scapegoats for their economic struggles.</p>
<h2>What are the Trends of Inequality in India?</h2>
<h3>India’s Gini Coefficient</h3>
<p>In 2023, India's Gini coefficient was 0.410, a significant increase from 0.371 in 1955, indicating a rise in income inequality.</p>
<h3>Income Distribution in India</h3>
<p>In India, the wealth distribution is highly skewed, with the top 10% holding 77% of the country's wealth. The top 1% controls over half of the nation's wealth, further underlining the extent of inequality.</p>
<h2>India’s Initiatives to Reduce Inequality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)</li>
<li>Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP)</li>
<li>Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)</li>
<li>Samagra Shiksha Scheme 2.0</li>
<li>National Health Mission</li>
</ul>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>To combat rising inequality, India needs to enforce stronger constitutional provisions for equality, implement progressive taxation, and promote corporate social responsibility. Addressing global inequality requires financial reparations, gender equality, and environmental justice.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<p>In conclusion, global inequality is a pressing issue that requires comprehensive and coordinated action. While some progress has been made, much remains to be done to bridge the wealth gap and ensure fairer economic opportunities for all. Only through collective efforts and structural changes can we hope to address these disparities and promote a more equitable world.</p>
