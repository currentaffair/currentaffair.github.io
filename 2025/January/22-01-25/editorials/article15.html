<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Recent reports from the Election Commission of India (ECI) have highlighted a significant surge in political donations made through electoral trusts. This article explores the implications of this shift, particularly after the 2024 Supreme Court ruling which declared the electoral bonds scheme unconstitutional, and examines the role of electoral trusts in the funding landscape of Indian politics.</p>
<h3>Key Highlights of the ECI’s Report</h3>
<p>The report for FY 2023-24 reveals an almost three-fold increase in donations to the Prudent Electoral Trust (PET). PET, the largest electoral trust in India, received a substantial Rs 1,075.71 crore in this period. The ruling party (BJP) was the primary beneficiary of these donations, followed by Congress, Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), and YSR Congress. Despite the fact that there are over 15 electoral trusts recognized by the ECI, only five trusts, including PET, received donations during this period.</p>
<h3>Implications of the Shift in Political Funding</h3>
<p>In comparison to the electoral bonds scheme, which facilitated anonymous donations worth Rs 12,000 crore from 2018 to 2023, the recent Supreme Court ruling has led to a shift towards electoral trusts. This shift enhances transparency by requiring trusts to disclose donor identities, amounts, and recipient parties. In the case of PET, 74% of their donations were made after the court ruling, indicating a clear trend toward more transparent political funding.</p>
<h3>Economic Dimensions</h3>
<p>Electoral trusts provide a legal avenue for large-scale corporate donations to flow into the political system, influencing party finances. The dominance of trusts like Prudent and Triumph has resulted in the centralization of political funding, making a few donors significantly more influential in political outcomes.</p>
<h3>What are Electoral Trusts?</h3>
<p>Electoral trusts, introduced in 2013, are non-profit entities created to collect and distribute funds to political parties. They are regulated under the Companies Act and must donate at least 95% of their collected funds to eligible political parties. Unlike electoral bonds, electoral trusts provide full disclosure of donors' identities and the amounts contributed.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="conclusion">
<p>The shift in political funding from electoral bonds to electoral trusts marks a significant change in the landscape of Indian politics. While this change enhances transparency and accountability, concerns about corporate influence on politics remain. Moving forward, balancing transparency with donor anonymity and regulating donations will be key to ensuring a fairer and more democratic political system.</p>
