<section>
<img alt="Rubber Industry Image" src="https://www.industrialrubbercomponents.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rubber-Company.jpg"/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Rubber Board in India has launched new initiatives such as the Indian Sustainable Natural Rubber (iSNR) and INR Konnect Platform to improve the global standing and increase domestic production of rubber. These efforts align with the National Rubber Policy (NRP) 2019, which is focused on creating a sustainable and competitive rubber industry.</p>
<h2>Recent Initiatives in India's Rubber Industry</h2>
<h3>iSNR Initiative</h3>
<p>The Indian Sustainable Natural Rubber (iSNR) initiative aims to meet the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) standards by ensuring the traceability of rubber products. This initiative helps verify the origin of rubber and facilitates easier compliance for stakeholders targeting European markets. The focus is on making Indian rubber both sustainable and globally competitive.</p>
<h3>INR Konnect Platform</h3>
<p>INR Konnect is a web-based platform designed to boost productivity by linking growers of untapped rubber plantations with potential adopters. It targets plantations held by absentee landlords, focusing on increasing rubber yields and reducing the costs associated with neglected plantations.</p>
<h3>mRube</h3>
<p>mRube is a digital marketing platform launched by the Rubber Board to enhance the marketing and trade of natural rubber. This platform aims to increase the efficiency of the rubber sector by connecting stakeholders across the value chain.</p>
<h3>Subsidy Hike</h3>
<p>The Indian government has announced plans to gradually increase subsidies for rubber cultivation to incentivize production and ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector.</p>
<h2>Understanding the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)</h2>
<p>The EUDR aims to prevent the global issue of deforestation and forest degradation by regulating commodity supply chains. Products entering the EU market must be proven to not originate from deforested land. The regulation focuses on several commodities, including rubber, and has significant implications for India's rubber exports.</p>
<h3>Objectives of EUDR</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prevent deforestation linked to commodity production.</li>
<li>Reduce carbon emissions by at least 32 million metric tonnes annually.</li>
<li>Combat forest degradation resulting from agricultural expansion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities Covered by EUDR</h3>
<p>The EUDR covers commodities such as rubber, palm oil, cocoa, soy, and others. India's rubber industry, in particular, faces challenges in meeting these regulations.</p>
<h3>Concerns Related to EUDR</h3>
<p>India views the EUDR as a non-tariff barrier that could impose additional certification and compliance burdens on small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Moreover, it could slow down ongoing negotiations for free trade agreements (FTAs) between India and the EU.</p>
<h2>Key Facts About Rubber</h2>
<p>India is one of the largest producers and consumers of natural rubber globally, with Kerala being the largest producer. Rubber requires tropical conditions, and India has a favorable climate for its cultivation, especially in states like Kerala and Tripura.</p>
<h3>Global Trade in Rubber</h3>
<p>In 2022-23, India exported 3,700 tonnes of natural rubber, with key markets including the USA, Germany, and the UAE. However, the country is also a major importer of rubber, with imports mainly coming from countries like Indonesia and Thailand.</p>
<h2>Government Initiatives and Policies</h2>
<p>The Indian government has introduced various initiatives under the National Rubber Policy (NRP) 2019 to boost domestic production, including the Rubber Plantation Development Scheme and the promotion of 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in rubber plantations.</p>
<h3>National Rubber Policy 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enhances the entire rubber industry value chain from cultivation to manufacturing.</li>
<li>Focuses on increasing rubber plantations in non-traditional regions.</li>
<li>Aims to increase the productivity of rubber plantations through advanced agro-management techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategies to Boost Rubber Production in India</h2>
<p>Several strategies can help increase rubber production in India, including land diversification, scientific farming techniques, and research into disease-resistant rubber varieties. Additionally, improving tapping methods and expanding market access can encourage farmers to produce more rubber.</p>
<h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>India is making strides to strengthen its rubber industry through innovative initiatives like iSNR, INR Konnect, and mRube, all of which aim to increase production, enhance sustainability, and ensure competitiveness. While challenges like compliance with EUDR and global market access remain, these efforts are crucial to positioning India as a leader in the global rubber market.</p>
