<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The International Labour Organisationâ€™s (ILO) "World Employment and Social Outlook (WESO): Trends 2025" report has made significant waves in understanding the current state of global employment. Despite challenges like slow economic recovery and geopolitical tensions, the report reveals a stable global unemployment rate. This article explores key findings, their implications, and what they mean for the future of work.</p>
<h2>Key Highlights of the WESO Trends 2025 Report</h2>
<h3>Steady Global Unemployment</h3>
<p>The global unemployment rate remained stable at 5% in 2024, a historic low. However, youth unemployment remains a significant challenge at 12.6%. Countries with higher income levels such as upper-middle-income nations face youth unemployment rates as high as 16%, while low-income countries show relatively lower figures at 8%. This discrepancy often stems from underemployment and informal work structures.</p>

<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Youth unemployment is considerably higher in upper-middle-income countries compared to low-income nations.</p>

<h3>Regional Disparities in Employment</h3>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa continues to face a major challenge with informal employment, where around 62.6% of households earn less than USD 3.65 a day. Similarly, many developing nations experience growing employment, but workers often remain in low-paying, unstable jobs.</p>
<h3>Economic Growth Trends</h3>
<p>Global economic growth for 2024 stood at 3.2%, slightly down from the previous years. Projections for 2025 show similar growth, followed by a gradual deceleration. The jobs gap, which measures the number of people who desire but cannot find work, stands at 402 million. This includes 186 million unemployed individuals and millions more in underemployment.</p>
<h3>Labour Force Participation</h3>
<p>Participation in the labor force has increased in advanced economies, particularly among older workers and women. However, low-income countries have seen a decline, resulting in slower global employment growth.</p>
<h3>Stagnant Wages Amid Shifting Labor Dynamics</h3>
<p>Real wage growth remains weak post-pandemic, as employers continue to hold significant power in the labor market. This stagnation is a concern for global economic stability and individual livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Green Transition and Digital Economy</h3>
<p>The renewable energy sector saw significant job growth, particularly in solar and hydrogen energy sectors. However, job growth in the digital economy has been uneven, with countries struggling to build the necessary infrastructure and workforce.</p>
<h2>ILO Recommendations for Achieving Social Justice and SDGs by 2030</h2>
<h3>Leverage Remittances</h3>
<p>The ILO recommends channeling remittances into productive investments rather than consumption, especially in LICs, where remittances can play a crucial role in boosting economic growth and long-term development.</p>
<h3>Structural Transformation</h3>
<p>Addressing structural bottlenecks by focusing on modern services and manufacturing can lead to quality job creation and reduce regional disparities. Investments in infrastructure and education are key to sustainable growth.</p>
<h3>Youth Skill Development</h3>
<p>Providing quality education and training to youth will ensure they are equipped to participate in modern labor markets and emerging industries like green energy and technology.</p>
<h3>International Collaboration</h3>
<p>Promoting global cooperation and inclusive policies is critical to ensuring the benefits of economic growth are shared across all worker demographics, reducing inequality and promoting sustainable development.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The WESO Trends 2025 report provides a comprehensive view of the state of global employment, highlighting the challenges and opportunities ahead. While unemployment remains at historic lows, youth unemployment, informal work, and stagnant wages present major concerns. Addressing these issues through strategic investments, skill development, and international cooperation is crucial to achieving the social justice goals outlined for 2030.</p>
