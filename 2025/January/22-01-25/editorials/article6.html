<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>India has recently achieved a groundbreaking milestone by performing two complex heart surgeries using the first indigenous surgical tele-robotic system, SSI Mantra. This achievement demonstrates significant progress in robotic-assisted surgeries, helping bridge geographical gaps in healthcare accessibility. The implementation of such advanced technologies is poised to revolutionize the way healthcare is provided, especially in underserved or remote regions.</p>
<h2>What is SSI Mantra?</h2>
<p>SSI Mantra is India's first indigenous surgical robotic system that has received regulatory approval for telesurgery. Developed by SS Innovations, it is certified by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO). This system is designed to enable surgeons to perform complex procedures remotely, minimizing the distance between medical professionals and patients in need of advanced care.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<p class="highlight">SSI Mantra operates with ultra-low latency of 35–40 milliseconds, ensuring precise, real-time remote operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>High-precision surgeries: Specifically designed for intricate cardiac procedures, like the Totally Endoscopic Coronary Artery Bypass (TECAB).</li>
<li>Regulatory approval: SSI Mantra is the first robotic system authorized for telesurgery and remote surgical training.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Working Mechanism</h3>
<p>SSI Mantra operates on a Master-Slave Console Model. The Master Console allows the lead surgeon to perform precise movements from a remote location, while the Slave Console executes the surgeon’s commands using robotic instruments at the patient’s location. This system ensures high accuracy and minimal invasiveness, leading to better patient outcomes.</p>
<h3>Significance</h3>
<p class="important">The key advantage of this system is its ability to overcome geographical barriers, providing expert surgical care to remote or underserved areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, its minimally invasive techniques help reduce recovery times, lower complications, and improve the overall patient experience, making it a critical tool for the future of global healthcare.</p>
<h2>What are Robots?</h2>
<p>Robots are autonomous machines capable of performing tasks with minimal human intervention. These machines incorporate various technologies, including computer science, mechanics, electronics, and materials science. The broad use of robots is transforming industries such as healthcare, defense, agriculture, and more.</p>
<h3>Types of Robots</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Mobility-based:</b> Fixed (e.g., assembly line robots) or mobile (e.g., legged or wheeled robots).</li>
<li><b>Ability-based:</b> Type I robots perform tasks better than humans (e.g., precision cutting), while Type II robots handle dangerous tasks (e.g., space exploration).</li>
<li><b>Shape-based:</b> Mechanical (industrial robots), Animal (e.g., Robo Dog), and Humanoid robots (e.g., Sofia, the gynoid robot).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications of Robotics</h2>
<p>Robots are making significant strides across various sectors. In healthcare, they assist in surgeries, prosthetics, and patient monitoring, improving efficiency and outcomes. In industry, robots contribute to manufacturing and assembly, with China leading global installations. In agriculture, robots help in tasks like crop management, and in defense, they support logistics and surveillance.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Robotics in India</h3>
<p>Between 2016 and 2021, India saw a significant increase in the adoption of industrial robots. Despite the growth, India’s robotics ecosystem is still developing compared to more advanced nations.</p>
<h3>Challenges in Adopting Robotics in Healthcare</h3>
<p>Several barriers still hinder the widespread adoption of robotic systems in healthcare, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>High initial costs:</b> Robotic systems like SSI Mantra are expensive to acquire and maintain, limiting accessibility for smaller hospitals.</li>
<li><b>Training and skill gaps:</b> Surgeons and medical staff require specialized training to operate these systems effectively.</li>
<li><b>Ethical concerns:</b> Telesurgery raises issues of accountability and patient safety.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>To make robotic systems more accessible, governments can offer subsidies, and hospitals may explore leasing or financing options. Additionally, establishing clear ethical frameworks and enhancing cybersecurity measures will help mitigate concerns surrounding telesurgery.</p>
<div class="conclusion">In conclusion, while robotics in healthcare presents vast potential, addressing the challenges in cost, training, ethics, and cybersecurity is essential to ensure its success and accessibility for all.</div>
