<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The shifting international stance toward radical groups such as the Taliban and Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) has raised significant questions about the global approach to legitimizing factions that have previously been deemed enemies of democracy. This transformation in policy and recognition has major implications not only for regional stability but also for global diplomatic relations. This article delves into the circumstances leading to the legitimization of these groups, their geopolitical consequences, and the strategic responses of nations like India.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Radical groups like the Taliban and HTS are often labeled as terrorists or threats to democracy. However, once they seize power, they gain an undeniable foothold in global politics. Countries that once viewed them as enemies now engage in diplomatic dialogues, often placing short-term stability above long-term democratic values. This article explores the various instances where such shifts have occurred and their subsequent impact on regional and global security.</p>
<h2>Taliban Takeover (Afghanistan, 2021)</h2>
<p>In August 2021, the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, marking a significant turning point in international relations. Initially condemned for their extreme policies, the Taliban began receiving global recognition under specific conditions. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed Resolution 2593, which called for the prevention of Afghanistan becoming a base for terrorism. Despite these conditions, the Taliban’s promises of inclusivity, particularly regarding women’s rights, were not fulfilled, highlighting the complex nature of their governance.</p>
<h3>HTS Takeover (Syria, 2024)</h3>
<p>In Syria, Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), led by Ahmed al-Jolani, emerged as a formidable force after toppling Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Historically tied to al-Qaeda, HTS’ rise to power marked a significant shift in U.S. policy. The United States removed al-Jolani from its terrorist bounty list, signaling a pragmatic shift in its approach to Syria, prioritizing stability over ideological purity. This move highlights the growing trend of engaging with radical groups when they capture power.</p>
<h2>Bangladesh Crisis (2024)</h2>
<p>The political crisis in Bangladesh in 2024, marked by the replacement of Sheikh Hasina’s government by a military-backed interim administration under Muhammad Yunus, saw the rise of radical groups such as Jamaat-e-Islami and Ansarullah Bangla Team. These groups capitalized on the political unrest to further their agenda, including anti-India rhetoric and attacks on minorities. The situation has raised national security concerns, especially for neighboring India, which has had a key role in stabilizing Bangladesh since 2008.</p>
<h2>India’s Role and Challenges</h2>
<p>India has played a critical role in stabilizing Bangladesh in the past, especially following the 2008 elections. However, the rise of radical groups and the current political instability presents India with a delicate challenge. India must balance its diplomatic engagement with the interim government while also countering the influence of radical groups. At the same time, India must be cautious not to legitimize these groups through its actions.</p>
<h3>Regional Security and Diplomatic Engagement</h3>
<p>Islamic radicalization in Bangladesh presents a potential threat to India's eastern borders. The growing anti-India sentiment fostered by radical groups could destabilize the region further. India's diplomatic efforts must therefore focus on countering radicalization while maintaining robust bilateral relations with Bangladesh. At the same time, India’s strategic goals of preserving regional stability and promoting democratic norms remain a priority.</p>
<h2>Broader Implications</h2>
<p>The global trend of legitimizing radical groups once they seize power undermines democratic values and threatens international stability. In a fragmented international order, where short-term stability is often prioritized over accountability, the actions of powerful nations have significant consequences for global governance.</p>
<h3>Religiophobia and Polarization</h3>
<p>Religiophobia is on the rise globally, and viewing radicalization solely through the lens of religion deepens societal divides. Understanding radicalization requires a nuanced approach, as it is shaped by political, social, and economic factors, not just religious ideology. Failure to acknowledge this complexity could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and exacerbate global polarization.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong> 
            - Radical groups gain international legitimacy once they gain power, shifting global diplomatic stances.
            - Afghanistan's Taliban and Syria's HTS represent instances where diplomatic engagement has occurred post-capture of power.
            - India faces unique challenges in maintaining regional stability while countering radicalization.
            </p>
</div>
<h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Global legitimization of radical groups is a growing trend that challenges traditional democratic norms. As geopolitical realities shift, nations like India must navigate complex diplomatic terrain to balance stability with the promotion of democratic ideals. The future of global governance hinges on whether international actors can address the root causes of radicalization and support long-term stability in regions affected by radical groups.</p>
