<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>India's Female Labour Force Participation (FLFP) has been steadily increasing in recent years, particularly in rural areas. According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data of 2023-24, FLFP has seen a significant rise, almost doubling from 18.2% to 35.5% over the past six years. This article examines the factors driving this growth, the challenges women face in the workforce, and potential strategies for further improving women's participation in economic activities.</p>
<h2>Factors Driving India’s Improved Female Labour Force Participation</h2>
<h3>Reduced Household Drudgery through Welfare Schemes</h3>
<p>Government schemes like Ujjwala Yojana (free LPG connections) and Har Ghar Jal (tap water to households) have eased women’s domestic burdens, giving them more time for economic activities. These programs have significantly reduced the time spent on manual tasks like collecting firewood and fetching water, especially in rural areas. As of 2022-23, Ujjwala Yojana beneficiaries had taken 344.8 million refills, and 78% of rural homes received tap water under the Jal Jeevan Mission, creating a direct impact on women's participation in agriculture and allied activities.</p>
<h3>Increased Employment under Government Schemes</h3>
<p>Women have benefited from wage employment schemes such as MGNREGA, where they represent 54.54% of the workforce. Similarly, the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) has empowered millions of women, helping them engage in micro-enterprises and financial activities, thus increasing their economic independence.</p>
<h3>Declining Fertility Rates and Smaller Families</h3>
<p>India's fertility rate has fallen to 2.0 as per the NFHS-5, 2021. Smaller families allow women to focus more on their careers and participate in paid work, particularly in urban areas where FLFP has risen significantly among younger women (ages 20-35).</p>
<h3>Improved Literacy and Education Levels</h3>
<p>Women's literacy rates in India have increased to 77%, with initiatives like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan helping to boost education. The rise in female literacy, along with vocational training programs like Skill India Mission and Digital Saksharta Abhiyan, has empowered women to enter emerging fields such as e-commerce and gig work.</p>
<h3>Shift Towards Self-Employment and Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>Financial inclusion initiatives such as PM Jan Dhan Yojana and the Stand-Up India Scheme have enabled more women to enter self-employment and entrepreneurship. As of March 2023, ₹40,710 crore in loans were sanctioned under Stand-Up India, with 80% of the funds allocated to women entrepreneurs, helping them achieve financial independence.</p>
<h3>Technology and Digitization as Enablers</h3>
<p>The expansion of internet access has created new opportunities for women to engage in gig and remote work. Platforms like Amazon Saheli and Mahila E-Haat have allowed women to sell products and services from home, overcoming mobility constraints.</p>
<h3>Supportive Legal Frameworks</h3>
<p>Progressive policies such as the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, which provides paid maternity leave, and the POSH Act, 2013, have created a more supportive environment for women in the workforce. These initiatives, along with the Women Reservation Act, 2023, signal political commitment to improving women’s representation in the workforce.</p>
<h2>Structural Challenges in India’s Female Labour Force Participation</h2>
<h3>Gendered Social Norms and Cultural Constraints</h3>
<p>Despite progress in economic development, deep-rooted gender norms still hinder women's full participation in the workforce. Traditional societal expectations often prioritize caregiving over career advancement, particularly in rural areas. According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2023, India ranks 127th out of 146 countries in terms of economic participation, highlighting these persistent gender biases.&lt;/p
