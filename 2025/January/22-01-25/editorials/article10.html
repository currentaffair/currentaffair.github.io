        Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) - Challenges and Recommendations

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was enacted in 2016 with the aim of resolving insolvencies in a time-bound manner, improving the ease of doing business in India. The IBC was designed to address the growing problem of bad loans and facilitate the resolution of non-performing assets (NPAs), thereby promoting financial discipline and accountability. However, despite the progressive intent, the IBC faces significant challenges that hinder its effectiveness in resolving insolvency cases efficiently.</p>
<h2>Current Challenges</h2>
<h3>Institutional Burden on Tribunals</h3>
<p>The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) are responsible for handling cases under both the IBC and the Companies Act. However, the tribunals face a severe institutional burden due to a lack of resources and an outdated structural framework. This has led to significant bottlenecks in the resolution process, delaying the proceedings and reducing the overall effectiveness of the IBC.</p>
<h3>Delays in Resolution</h3>
<p>One of the critical shortcomings of the IBC is the delay in the resolution of insolvency cases. The average time for insolvency resolution increased to 716 days in FY2023-24, far exceeding the target of 330 days. Judicial discretion in extending timelines, especially in complex cases, has undermined the efficiency and timeliness of the IBCâ€™s implementation.</p>
<h3>Capacity Constraints</h3>
<p>Another major issue faced by the IBC system is the inadequate domain knowledge among the tribunal members, especially when it comes to handling complex financial and legal cases. Furthermore, there is no mechanism in place for the urgent listing of cases, and registry staff have significant discretionary power over case listings. This has contributed to inefficiencies in the system.</p>
<h3>Defiance of Supreme Court Orders</h3>
<p>There has been an increasing trend of disregarding judicial directives, particularly in terms of adhering to prescribed timelines. This growing defiance threatens the integrity of the entire insolvency resolution framework and calls for stronger enforcement of judicial orders to ensure accountability and effective governance.</p>
<h3>Procedural Gaps</h3>
<p>The IBC framework is further burdened by procedural gaps, such as mandatory hearings for all applications, even when they are unnecessary. This contributes to unnecessary delays. Additionally, the limited adoption of alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation, further strains the tribunals, leading to backlogs in case resolutions.</p>
<h2>Recommendations for Reform</h2>
<h3>Enhance Institutional Capacity</h3>
<p>To tackle the institutional burden, specialized benches should be introduced for different case types, such as insolvency, mergers, and amalgamations. Members with relevant domain expertise should be appointed, alongside those with judicial experience, to ensure efficient and knowledgeable handling of cases.</p>
<h3>Streamline Procedures</h3>
<p>There is a need to streamline procedures by reducing the mandatory hearings for routine applications. The adoption of procedural innovations, such as pre-litigation mediation, could significantly reduce the backlog of cases and accelerate the resolution process.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure and Staffing Improvements</h3>
<p>Improving infrastructure and staffing is critical. Adequate courtrooms and permanent support staff should be provided to the tribunals. Additionally, investment in training programs for tribunal members and registry staff would help address capacity issues and improve efficiency.</p>
<h3>Strengthen Accountability</h3>
<p>Mechanisms should be implemented to monitor adherence to Supreme Court orders and prescribed timelines. Reducing the discretionary powers of registry staff can help improve transparency in case management and accountability within the system.</p>
<h2>Broader Perspective on Insolvency Resolution</h2>
<p>The focus of insolvency resolution needs to shift beyond mere debt recovery and emphasize economic rejuvenation. Attracting foreign investment and encouraging out-of-court settlements can help reduce the burden on tribunals and foster a more efficient resolution framework.</p>
<h2>The Jet Airways Case: Key Lessons</h2>
<p>The Jet Airways insolvency case highlights institutional inefficiencies and procedural bottlenecks that have hindered the effective resolution of insolvency cases. The case reinforced the need for strict adherence to timelines and domain expertise in handling complex insolvency matters.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has played a crucial role in addressing the issue of bad loans and improving the ease of doing business in India. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the effective and timely resolution of insolvency cases. By enhancing institutional capacity, streamlining procedures, improving infrastructure, and strengthening accountability, India can improve the efficiency of the IBC system and foster a more robust business environment.</p>
