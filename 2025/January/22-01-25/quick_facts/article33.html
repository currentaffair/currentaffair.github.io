<h1>Global International Migrant Workers Statistics 2022</h1>
<img alt="International Migrant Workers" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/f65fe94b47ec4618bfa454bf897f242d_8.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&amp;quality=80"/>
<p>International Migrant Workers (IMWs) made up 4.7% of the global labor force in 2022, equating to 167.7 million workers. This was a 30 million increase from 2013. The number consists of 155.6 million employed and 12.1 million unemployed but available for work. However, growth slowed to less than 1% annually from 2019 to 2022 due to the pandemic and economic disruptions.</p>
<h2>Age and Gender Distribution</h2>
<p>Male IMWs accounted for 61.3% of the total employed migrant workforce, while female IMWs were 38.7%. Despite representing a larger proportion of the total migrant population (64.9 million), the gender gap persists due to lower female representation in the migrant workforce. The majority of IMWs are prime-age workers aged 25-54, accounting for 74.9%.</p>
<h2>Sectoral Distribution of IMWs</h2>
<p>The services sector employed 68.4% of IMWs, with female workers making up 80.7% in this sector. In comparison, male IMWs in the services sector were 60.8%. The industry sector employed 24.3%, while only 7.4% of IMWs worked in agriculture, much lower than the 24.3% of non-migrants in the same sector.</p>
<h2>Factors Behind Male Migration</h2>
<p>Economic and social factors, such as demand for low-skill labor in construction, manufacturing, and care work, tend to attract more male migrants. Women face barriers such as social restrictions and fewer opportunities in sectors like construction.</p>
<h2>Top Host Countries for IMWs</h2>
<p>High-income countries hosted 68.4% of global IMWs, especially in services like healthcare, elder care, and education. Upper-middle-income countries hosted 17.4%. North America and Europe were major hosts, while Arab States accounted for 13.3% of the global IMW workforce.</p>
<h2>Key Drivers of IMW Growth</h2>
<p>The growing demand for workers due to aging populations in high-income countries and the expanding care economy (elder care, healthcare, child care) continue to attract migrant workers. Economic opportunities in high-income nations further contribute to the rise in international migration.</p>
