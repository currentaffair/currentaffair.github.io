<h2>About the Kuka Rebellion</h2>
<p>The Kuka movement was the first major reaction in Punjab against the British political order established after 1849. It combined religious reform with resistance to colonial rule and was spearheaded by the Namdhari sect (Kukas).</p>
<h2>Key Events</h2>
<p><strong>Peak of Rebellion:</strong> January 1872, marked by major clashes at Malerkotla and Malaudh Fort.</p>
<p><strong>Mass Executions:</strong> In January 1872, 49 Kukas were executed, and 17 more were blown up after surrendering. British forces, led by John Lambert Cowan, acted brutally to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<h2>Reasons for the Movement</h2>
<ul>
<li>Religious reform opposing social vices like meat consumption and alcohol.</li>
<li>Protests against colonial oppression and cow slaughter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the Namdhari Sect</h2>
<p>Founded by Satguru Ram Singh in 1857, the Namdhari sect challenged the status quo, promoted social reforms, and defied the British Raj. Namdhari Sikhs, also known as Kukas, are known for their unique style of Gurbani recitation and abstinence from certain practices like tea and coffee.</p>
