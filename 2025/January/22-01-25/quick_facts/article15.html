<h2>Key Points of Inquiry</h2>
<p><strong>Court’s Question:</strong> The Court is deliberating which committee should oversee the dam’s safety—the Supervisory or Statutory Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Justice Surya Kant’s Concern:</strong> The Court emphasized avoiding dual oversight and overlapping roles in managing the dam’s safety.</p>
<p><strong>Next Hearing:</strong> Scheduled for February 19, where both states will present their arguments.</p>
<h2>Dam Safety Act of 2021</h2>
<p><strong>National Committee Formation:</strong> The Act establishes a National Committee chaired by the Central Water Commission (CWC), with representatives from both the Centre and States.</p>
<p><strong>Functions:</strong> The Act focuses on creating policies and guidelines for dam safety, setting national standards for maintenance and safety.</p>
<h2>Positions of the States</h2>
<p><strong>Tamil Nadu’s Argument:</strong> Tamil Nadu urges cooperation and claims Kerala is obstructing resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Kerala’s Argument:</strong> Kerala contends that Tamil Nadu has failed to maintain the dam properly.</p>
<h2>Key Legal Debate</h2>
<p><strong>Supervisory vs. Statutory Committee:</strong> The Court is examining which committee is better suited to ensure the dam’s safety, while addressing potential overlapping concerns and risks.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Risks:</strong> The dam’s age and structural concerns make effective governance essential.</p>
<h2>Impact of the Decision</h2>
<p><strong>Streamlined Oversight:</strong> The Court’s decision could clarify authority and improve safety governance.</p>
<p><strong>Potential for Cooperation:</strong> The ruling may foster cooperation between Tamil Nadu and Kerala.</p>
<h2>Concluding Observations</h2>
<p><strong>Specialized Oversight:</strong> This case highlights the importance of effective oversight for critical infrastructure like dams.</p>
<p><strong>Dam Safety Act’s Role:</strong> The Act provides a national framework, but judicial intervention is crucial in this specific case.</p>
