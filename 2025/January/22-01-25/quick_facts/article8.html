<h2>Incident Overview</h2>
<p>The West Bengal government suspended 12 doctors for medical negligence after expired saline administration led to the death of a woman and her newborn child.</p>
<h2>Concerns &amp; Reactions</h2>
<p>The Joint Platform of Doctors raised concerns that the issue of fake medicines was being overshadowed by political motives. They criticized the government for distracting the public from the core problem. RL saline from Paschim Banga Pharmaceuticals was flagged for quality issues, with prior concerns about its role in maternal deaths. As a result, the government banned its use in medical facilities on January 14.</p>
<h2>About Intravenous (IV) Fluids</h2>
<p>IV fluids are liquids injected into a vein to treat dehydration and restore balance. They are essential for people of all ages, whether sick, injured, or undergoing surgery.</p>
<h2>Main Types of IV Fluids</h2>
<h3>Crystalloid Solutions</h3>
<p>These fluids contain small molecules that easily pass from the bloodstream into cells. Examples include Normal Saline, D5W, and Lactated Ringer's.</p>
<h3>Colloid Solutions</h3>
<p>These contain larger molecules and stay within blood vessels, maintaining blood volume. Examples include Albumin and Hetastarch.</p>
<h2>Importance of IV Fluids</h2>
<p>IV fluids help treat dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and support overall bodily function. They play a critical role in hospitalized patients' recovery and cellular health.</p>
