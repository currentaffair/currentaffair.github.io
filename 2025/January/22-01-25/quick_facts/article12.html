<h1>Supreme Court's Inquiry into Vehicle Ownership and Parking Issues</h1>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court is questioning restrictions on the number of vehicles a person can own and if laws require commercial and residential complexes to provide enough parking spaces.</p>
<h2>Key Observations</h2>
<p>The court raised concerns about the congestion and pollution caused by excessive vehicle ownership. Justice A.S. Oka pointed out that many individuals own multiple vehicles, contributing to the growing parking issues in residential complexes.</p>
<h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
<p>The court suggested adopting electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce pollution. However, the electricity used for EVs still largely comes from coal, contributing to pollution. An efficient public transportation system was also recommended to reduce reliance on private vehicles.</p>
<h2>Parking Policy Recommendations</h2>
<p>A comprehensive parking policy was suggested to manage the growing vehicle influx. The current lack of parking spaces leads to vehicles being parked on roads, worsening traffic and pollution.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear further arguments on these issues on February 3, 2025. Authorities such as the Ministry of Road Transport and the Ministry of Urban Affairs are required to respond to the queries.</p>
