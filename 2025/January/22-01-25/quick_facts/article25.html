<h1>Conflict in Tamil Nadu’s State Universities</h1>
<img alt="State Universities Conflict" src="https://media.collegedekho.com/media/img/institute/crawled_images/None/maxresdefault_THhIxfc.jpg?width=1080"/>
<h2>Core Issue</h2>
<p>Dispute over Vice-Chancellor (VC) appointments between the Governor (Chancellor) and the State government. The key disagreement lies in the inclusion of UGC representation in the VC search committee.</p>
<h2>Constitutional Dimensions</h2>
<p>Article 254(1) allows Central laws to override State laws in conflicts, but only plenary laws, not delegated legislation. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that subordinate legislation cannot override State laws.</p>
<h2>Legal Rulings</h2>
<p>Judgments such as Ch. Tika Ramji (1956) and University of Delhi vs. Raj Singh (1994) assert that UGC regulations are advisory for State universities unless adopted by the State. Recent cases like Kalyani Mathivanan (2015) and P.J. Dharmaraj (2024) further support this stance.</p>
<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>The ongoing conflict highlights the need for constitutional clarity on the limits of delegated legislation. It also impacts Centre-State relations, federalism, and higher education autonomy.</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The leadership vacuum has delayed administrative decisions, staff appointments, and degree awards in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Punjab.</p>
