<h1>Ghazipur Landfill Crisis</h1>
<img alt="Ghazipur Landfill" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/854m4n5c_ghazipur-landfill_625x300_14_July_18.jpg" style="width:100%; border-radius: 8px;"/>
<p>The Ghazipur landfill, situated at the Delhi-U.P. border, remains a major environmental and social issue for local residents. Despite claims of reducing its size, the landfill continues to negatively impact residents' lives, causing health risks and discomfort due to persistent odor.</p>
<h2>Longstanding Problem</h2>
<p>Operating since 1984, the landfill spans over 70 acres and is one of the largest waste disposal sites in Delhi. Located near residential colonies and significant landmarks like the Qutab Minar, its proximity to homes, farms, and slaughterhouses exacerbates environmental concerns.</p>
<h2>Infrastructural Challenges</h2>
<p>The area suffers from poor infrastructure, with water and electricity supply issues. Residents depend on water tankers that arrive every third day, and high electricity costs add to their struggles, contributing to a sense of neglect.</p>
<h2>Environmental Health Risks</h2>
<p>Fires at the landfill, especially in the summer and monsoon seasons, release toxic gases, aggravating health risks for nearby residents. These hazardous substances lead to air pollution and long-term environmental damage.</p>
