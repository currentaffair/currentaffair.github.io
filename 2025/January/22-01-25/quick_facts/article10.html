<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The inclusion of the mumps vaccine in the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) has been proposed by Tamil Nadu following a significant rise in mumps cases in the state. Currently, Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine is part of the UIP (introduced in 2017) but mumps remains uncovered.</p>
<h2>Universal Immunization Programme</h2>
<p>The Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is one of the largest public health initiatives globally launched by the Government of India to provide free vaccines against preventable diseases to all children and pregnant women. The program aims to reduce mortality and morbidity by ensuring high immunization coverage across the country.</p>
<h2>Functioning of UIP</h2>
<p>The UIP targets children aged 0-16 years (with a focus on those under 5) and pregnant women. It provides vaccines for diseases such as tuberculosis, polio, hepatitis B, diphtheria, pertussis, and more.</p>
<h2>Mission Indradhanush</h2>
<p>Launched on December 25, 2014, Mission Indradhanush aims to rapidly increase immunization coverage in areas with low coverage. The mission has successfully vaccinated millions of children and pregnant women across various phases.</p>
<h2>Measles, Mumps, and Rubella</h2>
<p>Measles, Mumps, and Rubella are preventable diseases caused by different viruses. Mumps causes swelling of the salivary glands and can lead to complications like orchitis and infertility. Measles can cause pneumonia and encephalitis, while Rubella may cause congenital defects in newborns if the mother is infected during pregnancy.</p>
