<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has been proactive in addressing Unsolicited Commercial Communications (UCC), commonly known as spam. Key initiatives include the Do-Not-Disturb (DND) registry, mobile applications for user preferences, and strict enforcement under the TCCCPR, 2018.</p>
<h2>Blockchain Technology in Fighting Spam</h2>
<p>In 2024, TRAI mandated blockchain use to enhance transparency and accountability in commercial messaging. Blockchain ensures an immutable and tamper-proof record of sender IDs and messages, preventing fraudulent activities and enhancing traceability.</p>
<h2>Effectiveness and Challenges</h2>
<p>While DND measures reduce spam from legitimate businesses, fraudsters have adapted with tactics like disposable numbers and VoIP calls, complicating enforcement.</p>
<h2>Government and Telecom Measures</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sanchar Saathi Portal:</strong> Tracks and cancels numbers linked to fraud.</li>
<li><strong>Telecom Security Operation Centre:</strong> Real-time monitoring of suspicious internet traffic.</li>
<li><strong>AI by Telecom Companies:</strong> Identifies suspicious calls, aiding users in recognizing potential threats.</li>
<li><strong>International Call Labeling:</strong> Helps distinguish legitimate and fraudulent calls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>TRAIâ€™s multifaceted approach, including blockchain, AI, and real-time monitoring, addresses spam effectively but faces ongoing challenges with evolving fraud tactics.</p>
