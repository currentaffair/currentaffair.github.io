<p><strong>Study Overview:</strong> A major ethnographic study was conducted by the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI) in collaboration with Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs), focusing on 268 denotified, semi-nomadic, and nomadic tribes. This study aimed to assess the inclusion of these communities in the SC, ST, and OBC lists across 26 states and UTs.</p>
<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p><strong>179 Communities Recommended:</strong> 179 communities were recommended for inclusion in the SC, ST, or OBC lists, with 85 new additions. The geographic spread is diverse, with Uttar Pradesh contributing the highest number of proposed additions.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Findings:</strong> Nine communities recommended for reclassification, and 63 communities were deemed "not traceable" due to migration or assimilation.</p>
<h2>Implications and Controversies</h2>
<p><strong>Impact on Quotas:</strong> The study's recommendations could significantly impact caste-based reservation systems, influencing political and social debates. However, there has been resistance from some communities who oppose being categorized under SC, ST, or OBC.</p>
<p><strong>Separate Quota Proposal:</strong> Some communities have proposed a separate quota or sub-quota for Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNT, NT, SNT) to address their unique challenges.</p>
