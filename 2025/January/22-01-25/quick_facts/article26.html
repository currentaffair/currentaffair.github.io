<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Kaveri engine, recently approved for in-flight testing, marks a significant step in India's indigenous aerospace development. It aims to power fighter jets like the LCA Tejas and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) like Ghatak.</p>
<h2>Development Timeline</h2>
<p>The Kaveri engine project began in the 1980s with the goal of creating a domestic solution for jet propulsion. Developed by GTRE and DRDO, the engine currently produces 49-51 kN of thrust, with plans to increase this to 73-75 kN.</p>
<h2>Features and Applications</h2>
<p>The engine's thrust capability and design make it suitable for fighter jets, UAVs, and autonomous systems like the Ghatak UCAV. The development has faced challenges but is progressing steadily with international collaborations.</p>
<h2>Testing and Development</h2>
<p>Extensive testing in both Russia and India has demonstrated the engine's reliability and stability. Its development has contributed to India's goal of achieving strategic autonomy in defense technology.</p>
<h2>Significance for Indian Aerospace</h2>
<p>The Kaveri engine project reduces India's dependence on foreign jet engine manufacturers, boosts the domestic aerospace industry, and enhances India's global competitiveness in aerospace technology.</p>
