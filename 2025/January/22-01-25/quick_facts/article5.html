<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Sumit Kumar, a 31-year-old teacher, founded "Appan Pathshala" in 2017 in Mukti Dham, a cremation ground in Muzaffarpur, Bihar. The school aims to educate children from slums and marginalized areas, focusing on academic and physical empowerment.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite facing resistance from parents, Kumar's initiative has flourished with support from local authorities and the community. The school's lack of infrastructure and limited resources didn't stop the program from succeeding.</p>
<h2>Impact on Students</h2>
<p>Students like Radhika Kumari and Mohammad Mubarak have shown significant growth, with many enrolling in government schools after attending Appan Pathshala. The program also fosters empowerment through Wushu martial arts for girls.</p>
<h2>Support and Recognition</h2>
<p>Recognized by the Muzaffarpur Municipal Corporation and financially supported by his family, Sumit Kumar has sacrificed his personal life for this cause, aiming to break the cycle of poverty and transform the community.</p>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>Sumit Kumar's goal is to enroll children in formal government schools, giving them the opportunity to earn recognized certifications and escape poverty.</p>
