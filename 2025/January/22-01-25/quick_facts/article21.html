<p>As wildfires become an increasing threat, especially due to climate change, satellite technology is being harnessed to better predict, detect, and monitor fires globally. This effort is aided by the growing availability of satellite data and cheaper space launches.</p>
<h2>Satellite Roles in Wildfire Detection</h2>
<p>Satellites can detect wildfire-related phenomena, including dry areas, active fires, burnt areas, and smoke emissions. They help in detecting and monitoring these events across vast areas efficiently.</p>
<h2>Types of Satellites</h2>
<p>There are two primary types of satellites used for wildfire detection:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low-Earth Orbit Satellites (LEO):</strong> These orbit below 1,000 km and provide high-resolution ground images but have a limited field of view.</li>
<li><strong>Geostationary Satellites:</strong> Orbit at 36,000 km, offering continuous monitoring, but with lower resolution.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Innovative Satellite Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>EFA's New Low-Orbit Satellite Constellation:</strong> A planned constellation with 5-meter resolution, to help detect smaller fires.</li>
<li><strong>OroraTech’s FOREST-3 Nanosatellites:</strong> A system designed to improve detection times and provide precise data on wildfire locations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges with Data Management</h2>
<p>Managing the large amounts of data from satellites, such as ESA’s Sentinel-2, which generates 1 terabyte of data daily, poses a significant challenge. Efficient processing of this data is essential for real-time wildfire tracking.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning Solutions</h2>
<p>Machine learning techniques help analyze large datasets, enabling real-time fire detection, predicting outbreaks, and tracking fire progression.</p>
<h2>Impact of Satellite Data on Wildfire Management</h2>
<p>Satellite networks provide near real-time global fire activity monitoring, aiding in early warning systems and improving wildfire management decisions.</p>
