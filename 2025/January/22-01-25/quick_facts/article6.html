<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Union Cabinet has approved the refarming of 687 MHz of spectrum for mobile services. This increases the total available spectrum from 900 MHz to 1,587 MHz, addressing the growing demand for efficient spectrum usage and preparing for advanced technologies like 5G.</p>
<h2>About Spectrum</h2>
<p>Spectrum refers to radio frequencies used for transmitting wireless signals. It is auctioned in specific bands and allocated to operators for communication services. Different bands have unique properties impacting signal propagation.</p>
<h2>Key Spectrum Bands</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Band (&lt;1 GHz):</strong> Wide coverage; examples include 600 MHz and 900 MHz.</li>
<li><strong>Mid Band (1-6 GHz):</strong> Balances coverage and capacity; examples include 1800 MHz and 2300 MHz.</li>
<li><strong>High Band (&gt;24 GHz):</strong> High-speed over short ranges; includes millimeter wave spectrum.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Spectrum Refarming?</h2>
<p>Refarming reallocates older frequency bands to advanced technologies like 5G, optimizing network performance and capacity. It supports rural expansion and faster upgrades without new auctions.</p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>India is focusing on mid- and high-band spectrums for 5G. Refarming enables modernization, 5G readiness, and improved service quality for future technologies.</p>
