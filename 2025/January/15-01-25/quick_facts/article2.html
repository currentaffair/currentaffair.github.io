<h1>Linking Voter IDs with Aadhaar for Electoral Roll Accuracy</h1>

<p>The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have accused each other of manipulating electoral rolls ahead of Delhi Assembly elections. This has reignited the discussion around linking Voter IDs (EPIC) with Aadhaar numbers for better electoral roll accuracy.</p>
<h2>History of the Proposal</h2>
<p><strong>2015:</strong> The Election Commission (EC) launched the National Electoral Rolls Purification and Authentication Program (NERPAP) to address duplicate entries in electoral rolls by linking voter data with Aadhaar.</p>
<p><strong>2015 Supreme Court Ruling:</strong> The Court ruled that Aadhaar could only be used for welfare schemes and PAN linking, causing the EC to halt the NERPAP.</p>
<p><strong>2018 Puttaswamy Case:</strong> The Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act, prompting the EC to seek amendments to the Representation of the People Act, 1950.</p>
<p><strong>2021 Amendment:</strong> The RP Act and The Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, were amended to allow Aadhaar linkage, with the provision being voluntary.</p>
<h2>Implementation &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p><strong>2023 Clarification:</strong> The EC stated that Aadhaar submission is not mandatory, but Forms 6 and 6B for voter registration have not been updated yet.</p>
<p>The linkage aims to address issues like duplicate entries but raises concerns about the accuracy of Aadhaar data and its ability to remove non-citizens from the rolls.</p>
<h2>Pros of Linking EPIC with Aadhaar</h2>
<p><strong>Duplication Elimination:</strong> Linking Aadhaar with EPIC can help in removing duplicate entries from the electoral rolls, enhancing electoral accuracy. Over 650 million Aadhaar numbers have already been uploaded in the process of finalizing electoral rolls.</p>
<h2>Cons and Concerns</h2>
<p><strong>Errors in Aadhaar Database:</strong> Even minor errors could lead to wrongful rejections or deletions from the electoral roll.</p>
<p><strong>Aadhaar is Proof of Residence, Not Citizenship:</strong> It cannot confirm voter eligibility based on citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Risks:</strong> While Aadhaar linking may not directly violate privacy, there are concerns about misuse since electoral rolls are accessible to political parties.</p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p><strong>Public Confidence:</strong> Emphasize the benefits of linking EPIC with Aadhaar to clean up the electoral roll, ensuring a more transparent and efficient election process.</p>
<p><strong>Amend Forms:</strong> Modify Forms 6 and 6B to reflect that providing Aadhaar details is not mandatory, as clarified by the EC in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Protect Voter Privacy:</strong> Address concerns regarding privacy and ensure voter trust in the integrity of the electoral process.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Linking Voter IDs with Aadhaar could help eliminate duplicate entries but requires careful handling of privacy concerns, accuracy of data, and voluntary participation. Public awareness and updated forms are crucial in moving forward.</p>
