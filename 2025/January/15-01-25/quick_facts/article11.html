<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 data shows higher hysterectomy rates in India among low-income agricultural workers and affluent women, due to differing reasons.</p>
<h2>Reasons for High Hysterectomy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Poor hygiene, menstrual taboos, delayed gynecological care, and physical labor among agricultural workers.</li>
<li>Wealthier women opting for the procedure due to better affordability and access.</li>
<li>Financial incentives under schemes like Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) sometimes lead to unnecessary surgeries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Hysterectomy</h2>
<p>A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the woman's uterus (womb) performed for conditions like fibroids, endometriosis, abnormal bleeding, and pelvic inflammatory disease when other treatments fail. It is also used for cancer treatment and severe pelvic pain.</p>
<h2>Prevalence in India</h2>
<p>NFHS-5 data shows that 3% of women aged 15-49 in India have undergone a hysterectomy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Highest Prevalence: Andhra Pradesh (9%) and Telangana (8%)</li>
<li>Lowest Prevalence: Sikkim (0.8%) and Meghalaya (0.7%)</li>
<li>The Southern region has the highest prevalence (4.2%), followed by the Eastern region (3.8%).</li>
