<h2>Launch Details</h2>
<p>The PSLV C60 rocket launched two satellites, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target), as part of the SPaDeX mission on December 30, 2024, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota.</p>
<h2>Trial Update</h2>
<p>In the trial attempt, ISRO successfully brought the satellites within 3 meters of each other. Initially, they were 15 meters apart. However, due to unexpected drift between the satellites, the docking attempt was delayed from January 7 to January 8, 2025. ISRO overcame this issue and is proceeding with further analysis before attempting the docking.</p>
<h2>Significance of the Mission</h2>
<p>The SPaDeX mission is crucial for advancing technologies necessary for future space missions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending an Indian astronaut to the moon.</li>
<li>Moon sample return missions.</li>
<li>Establishing an Indian space station.</li>
</ul>
<p>Success will position India alongside leading countries like the U.S., Russia, and China in mastering spacecraft docking technology.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>After analyzing trial data, ISRO will attempt the docking again. If successful, India will join the ranks of the U.S., Russia, and China in this critical space technology.</p>
