<h1>Kerala's Rising MMR: Causes and Impacts</h1>
<img alt="MMR Kerala" src="title-image.jpg"/>
<p><strong>Kerala’s maternal mortality rate (MMR) is rising, currently reported at 19 per one lakh live births. The State Health Department estimates it at 29. However, the increase in MMR is due to declining fertility rates, not necessarily more maternal deaths.</strong></p>
<h2>Declining Births in Kerala</h2>
<p>Kerala’s fertility rate has dropped to a historic low of 1.46 (2021 VSR), well below the replacement level of 2.1. This has resulted in fewer births – from 5-5.5 lakh annually to 3.93 lakh in the latest data.</p>
<h2>Impact of Declining Fertility</h2>
<p>Reduced births are causing an increase in MMR despite stable maternal health outcomes. Kerala’s demographic transition leads to fewer children born and an expected rise in the elderly population, creating future social challenges.</p>
<h2>Demographic Transition</h2>
<p>Since 1987-88, Kerala has maintained replacement-level fertility. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) dropped to 1.46 in 2021, with projections suggesting further declines to 1.35.</p>
<h2>Social and Economic Consequences</h2>
<p>Migration for jobs and education contributes to low birth rates. In the next decade, Kerala’s elderly population will surpass children, posing challenges in caregiving and welfare.</p>
<h2>Delayed Childbearing Risks</h2>
<p>The rising age of marriage and delayed childbearing may increase pregnancy-related morbidities, although the evidence is still limited.</p>
<h2>Population Data and Reporting Concerns</h2>
<p>Discrepancies in official birth registration data and delayed publication of the Vital Statistics Report (VSR) after 2021 hinder accurate understanding of demographic trends.</p>
<h2>Health Department’s Response</h2>
<p>Despite structural challenges, the State Health Department is working to address maternal health issues, though maintaining MMR at 20 by 2030 is increasingly unlikely due to demographic shifts.</p>
