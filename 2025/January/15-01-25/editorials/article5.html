    Iran’s Capital Shift to Makran and Alexander’s Legacy
</header>

<section>
    <img src="makran-image.jpg" alt="Makran Region Overview">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Iran's recent plans to relocate its capital from Tehran to the southern coastal region of Makran has attracted global attention due to its economic, strategic, and historical significance. The decision is fueled by concerns over Tehran's overpopulation, pollution, and resource shortages, which have reached a critical point. Historically, the region also holds importance due to its association with Alexander the Great's military retreat. This article explores both the contemporary geopolitical moves and the ancient legacy that shapes the region's significance.
    </p>

    <h3>Why in News?</h3>
    <p>
        Iran's government has announced plans to move its capital from Tehran to the Makran coastal region in the Sistan and Baluchestan Province. The decision is driven by a series of environmental and economic challenges facing Tehran. Furthermore, the region carries a legacy linked to Alexander the Great's historical retreat after his invasion of India. The move is viewed as a potential solution to Tehran's overcrowding and resource crises, but it also opens up discussions on Iran’s long-term strategic objectives.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Facts Regarding Iran’s Plan to Relocate its Capital</h3>
    <h4>Historical Context</h4>
    <p>
        Tehran has served as Iran's capital for over two centuries. It was established as the capital during the Qajar dynasty in the late 18th century under Agha Mohammad Khan. Since then, it has remained the heart of political and cultural activities in Iran. However, the city now faces critical urbanization issues, prompting the government's proposal for relocation.
    </p>

    <h4>Makran’s Strategic Importance</h4>
    <p>
        The Makran coast, with its proximity to the Gulf of Oman, offers strategic advantages for Iran’s economy, particularly in maritime trade. The region includes significant oil reserves and vital ports like Chabahar, making it an economic hub for trade routes linking Central Asia with the Indian Ocean. The Chabahar Free Trade Zone, operational since 2003, is central to Iran’s plan to establish Makran as a thriving international trade corridor.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        Makran's location is crucial as it sits along key maritime trade routes and offers untapped economic potential for Iran.
    </div>

    <h3>What are Key Facts Regarding Alexander's Indian Invasion?</h3>
    <h4>About Alexander</h4>
    <p>
        Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia from 336 to 323 BC, is widely recognized for his unprecedented military conquests, which expanded his empire from Greece all the way to the Indian subcontinent. His encounter with India marks one of the most significant cultural and military exchanges between Europe and Asia.
    </p>

    <h4>Key Events during the Invasion</h4>
    <p>
        Alexander’s journey through India included notable events like the Battle of the Hydaspes, where he faced resistance from King Porus, and the subsequent retreat from the Hyphasis (Beas) River after his troops, weary and demoralized, refused to march further. The retreat led Alexander through the harsh Gedrosian Desert, where much of his army perished.
    </p>

    <h4>Effects of Alexander’s Invasion</h4>
    <p>
        The invasion set the stage for the spread of Greek culture in India, fostering trade and diplomatic connections. It paved the way for Greek settlements, including Alexandria in the Kabul region, which became important centers for cultural exchange. Additionally, Alexander’s campaign directly influenced the rise of the Mauryan Empire.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        Alexander's invasion opened trade routes that linked Greece and India, laying the foundation for future cultural and economic interactions.
    </div>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <div class="conclusion">
        Iran's plan to relocate its capital to Makran is not just a response to current ecological and economic challenges but also a strategic move aimed at strengthening the country's position in global trade. Similarly, Alexander's invasion of India had long-lasting impacts, reshaping the cultural, political, and economic landscapes of both Greece and India. These historical and modern developments underscore the importance of geopolitical decisions in shaping the future of regions.
