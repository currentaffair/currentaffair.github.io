<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A study published in Nature Natural Hazards in July 2024 highlighted the urgent need for better disaster management strategies in landslide-prone regions such as Wayanad, Kerala. In this article, we explore the causes, impacts, and preventive measures related to landslides, with a focus on Wayanad's recent disaster.</p>
<h2>Why in the News?</h2>
<p>In July 2024, Wayanad district experienced a devastating landslide disaster due to extreme rainfall and fragile ecological conditions. A study in Nature Natural Hazards emphasized improving disaster management strategies in such vulnerable regions.</p>
<h2>Key Facts from the Study</h2>
<p>The study on landslides in Wayanad focused on understanding rapid debris flows and enhancing disaster management strategies. It used advanced techniques like Run-out Modelling and Rapid Mass Movement Simulation (RAMMS) to track debris flows, analyze risk zones, and provide better protective measures. The study found significant debris accumulation at lower elevations, historical patterns linking the 2024 landslide to earlier disasters, and emphasized the importance of vulnerability mapping.</p>
<h3>Key Findings</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Debris Accumulation:</span> Observed significant debris accumulation at lower elevations, posing future hazards downstream.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Vulnerability Mapping:</span> The study emphasized the need for detailed vulnerability maps to identify high-risk zones and prevent development in hazardous areas.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Early Warning Systems:</span> The importance of soil moisture and rainfall monitoring for early warnings and evacuation planning was highlighted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are Landslides?</h2>
<p>A landslide is the movement of rock, soil, and debris down a slope, triggered by various factors including rainfall, earthquakes, and human activity. Landslides can be categorized into different types:</p>
<h3>Types of Landslides</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slides:</strong> Movement along a rupture surface, including rotational and translational slides.</li>
<li><strong>Flows:</strong> Soil or rock mixed with water moving like a fluid, such as earth flows and debris flows.</li>
<li><strong>Spreads:</strong> Lateral extension of the mass, typically due to liquefaction.</li>
<li><strong>Topples:</strong> Forward rotation and free-fall from near-vertical slopes.</li>
<li><strong>Falls:</strong> Detachment from a steep slope or cliff, descending by free-fall, bouncing, or rolling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Landslide-Prone Areas in India</h2>
<p>India has several regions prone to landslides, including the Himalayas, Western Ghats, and other vulnerable areas. According to the Landslide Atlas of India, around 12.6% of the country's land area is susceptible to landslides.</p>
<h2>Causes of Landslides</h2>
<h3>Natural Factors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy Rainfall:</strong> Increases soil moisture, reducing stability and triggering slides.</li>
<li><strong>Earthquakes:</strong> Cause destabilization of slopes, particularly in tectonically active areas.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrological Factors:</strong> Water seepage through porous materials raises pore pressure, weakening slopes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anthropogenic Factors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Loss of vegetation weakens slopes and increases erosion.</li>
<li><strong>Urban Development:</strong> Road construction and mining disrupt natural drainage and load distribution.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measures to Prevent Landslides</h2>
<h3>Engineering Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slope Stabilization:</strong> Use of retaining walls and soil reinforcement techniques to prevent soil movement.</li>
<li><strong>Drainage Systems:</strong> Installation of
