        Analysis of the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules of 2025
    </header>
    <section>
        <img src="title-image.jpg" alt="DPDP Rules Analysis">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules of 2025, while being a significant step towards operationalizing India’s data protection framework, have raised concerns about executive overreach, vague governance, and the lack of an independent regulatory body. This article will explore the key issues, provide multiple viewpoints, and analyze the implications of the DPDP Rules, offering critical insights into the challenges they present for data protection in India.</p>

        <h2>Executive Overreach and Concentration of Power</h2>
        <p>The draft rules extend the centralized control of the government over the digital ecosystem. While rulemaking is essential for translating legislation into actionable policies, these rules grant the government unchecked discretion under vague provisions.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The rules mandate that compliance obligations and consent mechanisms can be decided by companies or dictated by the government without transparent standards. This leaves businesses vulnerable to arbitrary directions and unpredictable regulatory requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Additionally, the absence of specific timelines for data breach notifications or clear definitions of “clear and plain language” shows that the government retains significant leeway to interpret compliance, which increases the risk of state-led interventions in personal data handling.</p>

        <h2>Lack of Independence for the Data Protection Board (DPB)</h2>
        <p>The Data Protection Board (DPB), responsible for enforcing compliance and adjudicating data breaches, lacks functional independence. The selection process for the DPB is controlled by the executive, which raises concerns about political influence.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Key Issues:</strong> The DPB’s members, including the chairperson, are appointed by a selection committee led by the Cabinet Secretary. This process makes the DPB subservient to government interests, with members having service conditions aligned with central government employees, reducing their ability to act independently. Furthermore, there is no provision for the removal of DPB members in an insulated manner, increasing the risk of government interference.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The lack of an autonomous regulatory authority raises serious concerns about accountability, especially in cases involving government entities like the UIDAI (which manages Aadhaar).</p>

        <h2>Vague Provisions and Lack of Transparency</h2>
        <p>The draft rules are characterized by vague language, which allows the government to interpret and enforce regulations according to its own discretion.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Rule 22 grants the government the power to requisition data from companies, but lacks limitations or safeguards on how this power will be exercised. The absence of clear procedural safeguards opens the door to misuse of data by the state.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Furthermore, the decision to keep public consultations restricted to the MyGov platform and classified as fiduciary limits public participation and accountability. This approach resembles a corporate consultation model rather than a democratic, inclusive policy-making process.</p>

        <h2>Exemptions for Government Processing</h2>
        <p>The rules provide wide exemptions to government agencies under Rule 5, particularly for data processing related to subsidies, welfare programs, or state-provided services.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Key Concern:</strong> Exempting the government from consent requirements undermines citizen privacy rights. For instance, Aadhaar-linked welfare exclusions highlight how data misuse can lead to denial of essential services to vulnerable populations.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This exemption demonstrates a double standard — strict compliance is required from businesses, but government entities remain unaccountable for the same practices.</p>

        <h2>Procedural Integrity and Digital Leash</h2>
        <p>The draft rules fail to incorporate procedural safeguards to prevent state surveillance or arbitrary data requisition. The absence of checks and balances on the government’s power to requisition information or enforce data processing policies is akin to a “digital leash” — a term used to describe how the state can control citizens through their digital footprints.</p>
        <p>This authoritarian tendency is highlighted in the UIDAI’s opaque governance of Aadhaar, where data correction and dispute redressal mechanisms remain highly inaccessible to the marginalized.</p>

        <h2>Historical Context: K.S. Puttaswamy Judgment</h2>
        <p>The K.S. Puttaswamy judgment (2017) reaffirmed privacy as a fundamental right, yet the digital policies of the Indian state seem to contradict the spirit of the judgment.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Key Issue:</strong> The broad discretionary powers granted to the executive through the draft rules erode privacy protections and individual autonomy. This shift towards state control over personal data can lead to mass surveillance and erosion of democratic freedoms.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Comparing the Draft Rules with Global Standards</h2>
        <p>While the EU’s GDPR is criticized for being overly prescriptive, it ensures robust regulatory independence and stringent checks on government powers. In contrast, India’s draft rules lack a strong regulatory body, grant excessive discretionary powers to the government, and do not ensure transparency in data processing by state agencies. This deviation from global best practices reflects authoritarian tendencies in India’s approach to data protection.</p>

        <h2>Way Forward</h2>
        <p>To address these issues, the following steps are recommended:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Independent Data Protection Authority:</strong> Establish an autonomous body to oversee compliance and adjudication.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent Rulemaking:</strong> Ensure that public consultations are inclusive and submissions are made public for counter-comments.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit Government Powers:</strong> Define clear limitations and procedural safeguards on the government’s power to requisition data.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Privacy and Security:</strong> Ensure that rules protect individual privacy while addressing law enforcement needs without compromising constitutional rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules of 2025, while a step towards regulating digital privacy in India, reflect significant authoritarian tendencies. The centralization of power, lack of an independent regulatory body, and vague provisions in the draft raise concerns about government overreach and the erosion of privacy protections. Moving forward, it is crucial to establish an independent body to ensure balanced data protection and safeguard democratic freedoms.</p>
