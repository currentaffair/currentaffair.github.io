    India's Digital Personal Data Protection Draft Rules

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On January 3, 2025, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the much-anticipated Draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules. This marks a key milestone in India’s effort to regulate digital personal data, following the passage of the DPDP Act, 2023. This law brings India closer to operationalising its framework for safeguarding personal data.</p>
<h3>Departure from the Personal Data Protection Bill</h3>
<p>The draft rules represent a departure from the earlier, controversial Personal Data Protection Bill. Many felt the Bill was overly restrictive and hostile to industry interests. The Bill underwent extensive consultations over nearly a decade, but was eventually rescinded due to its untenable nature. In contrast, the DPDP Rules adopt a principles-based approach, which has garnered positive responses from businesses and the media.</p>
<h3>Refreshing Alternative to the EU's Policies</h3>
<p>Unlike the European Union's (EU) interventionist approach to digital data regulation, which includes the highly debated GDPR, India’s rules offer a measured and pragmatic alternative. The GDPR, once seen as the gold standard, has faced criticism for favoring large corporations and stifling smaller enterprises.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Key Highlight:</strong> India's Digital Personal Data Protection Rules offer a refreshing contrast to the GDPR’s more prescriptive and interventionist approach.</p>

<h2>The Hits: Pragmatism and Flexibility</h2>
<h3>Simplicity and Clarity</h3>
<p>A standout feature of the DPDP Rules is their principles-based framework for notice and consent. Unlike the GDPR, which has cumbersome requirements such as notifying users about indirect data acquisition, India’s rules focus on simplicity and clarity.</p>
<h3>Reducing Consent Fatigue</h3>
<p>India’s approach aims to minimize consent fatigue, which has been a significant issue in Europe. With GDPR's detailed and often irrelevant data processing notifications, users often face a constant barrage of consent pop-ups. In 2023, the European Commission introduced the Cookie Pledge Initiative to tackle this frustration. However, such course correction would have been unnecessary had the EU taken a less invasive approach to consent regulation.</p>
<h2>India’s Approach to User Rights and Consent Mechanisms</h2>
<p>India's DPDP Rules focus on outcomes rather than prescriptive processes, empowering users without burdening businesses and consumers with unnecessary complexities. The rules avoid dictating the specifics of how entities should allow users to exercise rights such as data correction, erasure, and withdrawal of consent.</p>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> India’s approach respects business autonomy while ensuring user rights are protected through simplified processes.</p>

<h2>Protection of Children’s Personal Data</h2>
<p>The draft rules impose stricter protections for children's personal data. However, they also acknowledge that children engage with digital technologies in ways that can benefit their education and development. Specific exemptions are made for educational institutions, health care providers, and child-care centers.</p>
<h3>Demonstrating Nuanced Policymaking</h3>
<p>These exemptions demonstrate a nuanced understanding of industry-specific needs and show the principles of thoughtful policymaking at play in India’s approach.</p>
<h2>The Misses: Data Localisation and Overreach</h2>
<h3>Complexity in Cross-Border Data Flow Restrictions</h3>
<p>The draft rules' provisions for restricting cross-border data flows introduce unnecessary complexity and ambiguity. These provisions could deter investment and lead to regulatory arbitrage, where smaller entities benefit from lighter regulations.</p>
<h3>Challenges in Localisation Provisions</h3>
<p>The localisation requirements for Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) and the potential overreach could create challenges for businesses and law enforcement agencies. The broad nature of these mandates may make it difficult for businesses to comply without significant costs.</p>
<h2>What Lies Ahead</h2>
<p>Data breaches in India cost businesses an average of ₹19.5 crore ($2.35 million) in 2024. As India moves forward with its data protection laws, it must balance notice-and-consent mechanisms with more robust privacy frameworks that better align with emerging technologies like 5G and AI.</p>
<h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As India refines its draft DPDP Rules, maintaining flexibility and ensuring industry-specific accommodations will be key to striking a balance between privacy protection, economic growth, and innovation. India’s approach has the potential to set a new standard for privacy regulation globally.</p>
