    SC Dismisses Review Petition on Same-Sex Marriage
</header>

<section>
    <img src="title-image.jpg" alt="SC Dismisses Review Petition on Same-Sex Marriage">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Supreme Court of India's recent judgment rejected review petitions against its October 2023 ruling, which refused to legalize same-sex marriages. This decision has sparked significant debate regarding LGBTQIA+ rights, marriage equality, and the role of the judiciary in advancing social reforms. The ruling carries substantial implications for India's legal framework surrounding same-sex couples and raises questions about the evolving interpretation of constitutional rights.</p>
    
    <h2>Background of the Supreme Court Judgment</h2>
    <p>In October 2023, a 5-judge bench, led by Chief Justice of India, ruled against recognizing same-sex marriage under Indian law. The judgment was delivered by a 3:2 majority, reinforcing the view that the Special Marriage Act (SMA) does not extend to same-sex couples. The ruling emphasized that matters concerning the legalization of same-sex marriage fall under the jurisdiction of Parliament and state legislatures, rather than the judiciary.</p>

    <h3>What is Same-Sex Marriage?</h3>
    <p>Same-sex marriage refers to the union between two individuals of the same gender, either between two men or two women. In India, same-sex marriage is not recognized by law, though recent developments have sparked debates about potential reforms.</p>

    <h3>Global Status on Same-Sex Marriage</h3>
    <p>As of 2024, over 30 countries, including the United States, Australia, and France, have legalized same-sex marriages. The Netherlands was the first to legalize it in 2001. On the other hand, some nations such as Iran and Saudi Arabia impose severe penalties on same-sex relationships, including the death penalty or corporal punishment.</p>

    <h2>The Special Marriage Act, 1954</h2>
    <p>The Special Marriage Act provides a legal framework for marriage between individuals of different religions or castes. It offers a civil approach to marriage, where the state, not religious authorities, sanctions the union.</p>

    <h3>Arguments in Favor of Same-Sex Marriage</h3>
    <p>Proponents of same-sex marriage argue that denying such unions violates fundamental rights, particularly under Article 21 (Right to Life) of the Indian Constitution. They cite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which upholds the right to marry as a fundamental human right, emphasizing equality and dignity.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Key Argument: </strong>Legalizing same-sex marriage would grant equal legal benefits to same-sex couples, including inheritance rights, social security, and access to healthcare.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Arguments Against Same-Sex Marriage</h3>
    <p>Opponents of same-sex marriage argue based on religious and cultural beliefs, asserting that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Others claim that the primary purpose of marriage is procreation, which they believe same-sex couples cannot fulfill.</p>

    <h2>LGBTQIA+ Rights in India</h2>
    <p>In India, the recognition of LGBTQIA+ rights has evolved over the years. Landmark judgments like the National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India (2014) recognized transgender individuals as a third gender. In 2018, the Supreme Court decriminalized same-sex relationships by striking down Section 377.</p>

    <h2>Way Forward</h2>
    <div class="important">
        <p><strong>Legal Reforms:</strong> Amendments to the Special Marriage Act or the introduction of contract-based agreements could grant same-sex couples the same rights and legal recognition as heterosexual marriages.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>The Supreme Court's dismissal of the review petition has significant implications for the LGBTQIA+ community in India. It highlights the ongoing need for legal reforms and societal dialogue to ensure that LGBTQIA+ individuals are granted equal rights and recognition under the law.</p>
