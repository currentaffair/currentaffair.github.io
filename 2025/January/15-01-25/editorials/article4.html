<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the review petition against its October 2023 ruling on same-sex marriage, refusing to legalize it. This decision brings attention to the ongoing debate regarding the legal recognition of same-sex marriages in India. The Court's majority ruling had earlier ruled that the Special Marriage Act (SMA), 1954, does not apply to same-sex couples.</p>
<h3>What is Same-Sex Marriage?</h3>
<p>Same-sex marriage refers to the union between two individuals of the same gender. It is legally recognized in several countries, though not in India, where same-sex marriage is not allowed. The Supreme Court’s 2023 decision underlined that it is the role of Parliament and state legislatures to make laws regarding same-sex marriage.</p>
<h3>Global Status of Same-Sex Marriage</h3>
<p>As of 2024, more than 30 countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, and France, have legalized same-sex marriages. The Netherlands led the way by becoming the first country to legalize it in 2001, followed by Taiwan, which became the first Asian nation to recognize such unions.</p>
<p>However, certain countries, such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia, continue to criminalize same-sex marriages, with severe penalties, including the death penalty.</p>
<h3>The Special Marriage Act (SMA) 1954</h3>
<p>The SMA allows for the legal union of individuals from different religions or castes, facilitating civil marriages in India. It provides a framework for marriage registration, allowing couples to register their marriage and enjoy associated rights like inheritance and social security benefits.</p>
<p>The Act applies to all Indian citizens, including foreigners who meet specific residency requirements. It also sets an age limit for marriage—21 for men and 18 for women.</p>
<h2>Arguments in Favor of Same-Sex Marriage</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Equality and Human Rights:</strong> Denying same-sex couples the right to marry undermines their basic human rights, contradicting international human rights conventions. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) affirms marriage as a fundamental right, emphasizing equality for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Legal and Economic Benefits:</strong> Legalizing same-sex marriage would provide couples with access to the legal and financial benefits associated with marriage, including inheritance, tax benefits, and social security. It aligns with global trends advocating for equality in legal rights.</p>
</div>
<h2>Arguments Against Same-Sex Marriage</h2>
<p>Opponents of same-sex marriage often cite religious and cultural beliefs, arguing that marriage should remain a union between a man and a woman. Others oppose it on the grounds of procreation, claiming that marriage is primarily for raising children, which they believe same-sex couples cannot fulfill.</p>
<p>Furthermore, critics argue that legalizing same-sex marriage could lead to complications in inheritance laws and adoption practices, especially in a society that has deep-rooted cultural and social biases against LGBTQIA+ individuals.</p>
<h2>LGBTQIA+ Rights in India</h2>
<p>India has made significant strides in recognizing the rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals. In 2014, the Supreme Court acknowledged transgender people as a "third gender." In 2018, the Court decriminalized same-sex relationships, declaring that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>In 2023, the Court rejected petitions to legalize same-sex marriages, which left many in the LGBTQIA+ community seeking alternative legal reforms.</p>
<h3>Way Forward</h3>
<p>Legal reforms are needed to grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples. Amendments to the Special Marriage Act could pave the way for legal recognition. However, a broader dialogue, including religious and cultural groups, would be essential to bring about societal acceptance and legal change.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While the Supreme Court’s ruling on same-sex marriage is a setback, it underscores the importance of ongoing legal and social debates. Legal reforms, combined with efforts to foster dialogue and engagement, could eventually lead to the recognition of same-sex marriages in India.</p>
