        Iran’s Capital Shift to Makran and Alexander’s Legacy
    </header>

    <section>
        <img src="makran_image.jpg" alt="Makran Coast">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Iran's proposal to relocate its capital from Tehran to the Makran coastal region is driven by a combination of economic, ecological, and geopolitical concerns. This shift is not only about modernizing the country's infrastructure but also about utilizing the strategic importance of the Makran region, historically tied to Alexander the Great's military campaign. The shift in capital marks a significant turning point in both modern and ancient history.</p>

        <h3>Background of the Proposed Capital Relocation</h3>
        <p>Tehran, the current capital, has been Iran's center of political and economic power for over 200 years. However, the city's rapid urbanization has led to significant challenges, including overcrowding, air pollution, water scarcity, and energy deficits. These pressing issues have driven the Iranian government to reconsider Tehran's status as the political hub of the nation. Thus, the idea of relocating the capital to a more strategically advantageous location, such as Makran, has gained traction.</p>

        <h3>Strategic Importance of Makran</h3>
        <p>The Makran region, located in the Sistan and Baluchestan Province, is home to vast untapped resources. Its coastline along the Arabian Sea offers significant potential for maritime trade, and the presence of vital ports like Chabahar positions Makran as a key player in Iran's economic future. This region's proximity to the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz enhances its strategic value, as it provides access to one of the most important shipping routes for global oil supply.</p>

        <h3>The Legacy of Alexander the Great in Makran</h3>
        <p>Makran is also historically significant, as it was the site of Alexander the Great's retreat following his invasion of India in 327–325 BCE. During this time, Alexander's army endured extreme hardships, with a significant portion perishing in the harsh conditions of the Gedrosian desert, now part of Makran. Despite the challenges, the campaign established crucial routes for trade and cultural exchange between Greece and the Indian subcontinent.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Makran's Role in Ancient and Modern Geopolitics</h3>
            <p>The Makran region has long been a strategic link between the East and West. Alexander's military campaigns in the region set the stage for subsequent cultural exchanges, which would later influence the course of Indian and Greek history. Today, Makran continues to hold significant geopolitical importance due to its strategic location and resources.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Effects of Alexander’s Invasion</h3>
        <p>Alexander’s invasion of the Indian subcontinent had profound impacts, including the establishment of Greek settlements in the region. Cities like Alexandria in Kabul and Boukephala along the Jhelum River are testament to the lasting influence of Greek culture. Furthermore, the Greek settlements paved the way for future trade relations, providing a foundation for the Mauryan Empire’s expansion and the eventual blend of Greek and Indian artistic traditions, as seen in Gandhara art.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The planned relocation of Iran's capital to Makran presents an opportunity for the nation to address urbanization challenges while leveraging the region's strategic and economic potential. The historical context of Alexander the Great's invasion adds a rich layer to the region's significance, highlighting Makran's role as a bridge between ancient civilizations and a key player in contemporary geopolitical strategies.</p>
