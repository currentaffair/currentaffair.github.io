    Trumpian Worldview and Global Geopolitics
</header>

<section>
    <img src="trump-image.jpg" alt="Trump Image">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Dissecting the psychology of the next U.S. President is a popular pastime. Trump's bold, disinhibited speaking style, his outspokenness, his focus on deal-making, and his real estate background that defines his coercive leadership and politics, cast him very differently from his predecessors. He is a polarizing figure, wading constantly into controversy, stubbornly resilient, a master of populist rhetoric, presenting himself as the voice of the "common people" against an out-of-touch political establishment.</p>

    <h2>Trump's Approach to Global Governance</h2>
    <h3>America First</h3>
    <p>Trump's approach to the "Rules-Based International Order" is shaped by an “America First” doctrine. He debunks multilateralism in global politics and trashes international agreements that he believes do not favor the United States. He prefers bilateral agreements over multilateral ones, as seen in his approach to the Paris Climate Agreement and trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump's skepticism towards international institutions, like the United Nations and NATO, stems from his belief that these disproportionately benefit other nations at the expense of the U.S. His foreign policy prioritizes American sovereignty over global governance.</p>

    <h3>Trumpian Worldview</h3>
    <p>In the Trumpian worldview, strategy revolves around the bully pulpit, strong personal branding, a willingness to take risks, unconventional deal-making, and a winner-takes-all mentality. Trump’s worldview is characterized by an emphasis on practical outcomes rather than theoretical constructs.</p>

    <h3>Trump's Transactionalism and MAGA Policy</h3>
    <p>Trump’s transactionalism has become legendary. His MAGA ("Make America Great Again") policy has global implications, including a rise in protectionism, escalating tariffs, and increasing economic uncertainty. The intensified competition with China is framed as a crucial challenge, with Beijing positioned as an economic and ideological adversary, affecting global stability, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

    <h3>Impact of Trump's Skepticism About Global Institutions</h3>
    <p>Trump’s skepticism about global institutions will encourage adventurism in global politics and nationalisms that override international law. This will lead to increasing polarization in global politics, particularly regarding free trade, immigration, and globalization. Furthermore, Trump’s stance is likely to downgrade climate policy and trigger instability in global markets, affecting nations worldwide.</p>

    <h2>American Isolationism and Its Global Consequences</h2>
    <p>American isolationism under MAGA could encourage countries like China and Russia to expand their global influence. As powers already united in opposition to U.S. dominance, they might use economic and military means to further their interests. MAGA could thus lead to disruption beyond American shores and trigger power realignments across the globe.</p>

    <h2>Ties with India: The Line for New Delhi</h2>
    <h3>Strategic Outlook for India-U.S. Relations</h3>
    <p>The strategic outlook for India-U.S. relations under a second Trump presidency is mixed. Relations between the two countries have evolved significantly over the last two decades. With the growing friendship between Prime Minister Modi and Trump, India will continue to emphasize constructive engagement with the U.S. as a key strategic partner.</p>

    <h3>Geopolitical Clout and Mutual Interests in Countering China</h3>
    <p>India’s growing geopolitical clout, combined with mutual interests in countering China, particularly regarding the over-assertive Chinese military posture, provides a strong foundation for a growing strategic partnership with the U.S. India-U.S. defense cooperation will continue to strengthen, though trade frictions might complicate relations.</p>

    <h3>Strengthening Groupings like the Quad</h3>
    <p>The U.S. administration’s focus on countering Chinese influence suggests that groupings like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) will be strengthened. India is cautious about over-reliance on the U.S., emphasizing strategic autonomy while seeking regional cooperation and multipolarity.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>The second Trump Presidency signifies a departure from established geopolitical patterns. With Trump’s victory, history's traditional guides to the global order may no longer apply, ushering in a disruptive, polarized, and unstable global environment. As Ian Bremmer noted, a G-Zero world has arrived, where global politics may be governed by the law of the jungle.</p>
