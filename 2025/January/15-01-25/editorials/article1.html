        SC Dismissed Review Petition on Same-Sex Marriage
    </header>
    
    <section>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="SC Dismissed Review Petition on Same-Sex Marriage">
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court of India's recent dismissal of review petitions regarding same-sex marriage has sparked widespread discussions on the issue. The court's judgment, which upheld its previous ruling from October 2023, has generated both support and opposition across the country. This article explores the background, the court's decision, the ongoing debate, and what lies ahead for the legalization of same-sex marriage in India.</p>
        
        <h3>What is Same-Sex Marriage?</h3>
        <p>Same-sex marriages refer to legal unions between individuals of the same gender, typically between two men or two women. While the concept of marriage varies globally, the right to marry has long been viewed as a fundamental human right in several countries.</p>
        
        <h3>Legality in India</h3>
        <p>In India, same-sex marriages are not recognized under current law, including the Special Marriage Act (SMA) of 1954. The Supreme Court's ruling reaffirms the stance that such marriages cannot be legalized without legislative action from Parliament.</p>
        
        <h3>Supreme Court Judgment of 2023</h3>
        <p>In a 3:2 majority verdict in October 2023, the Supreme Court ruled against legalizing same-sex marriages, citing that it is within the purview of Parliament and state legislatures to enact such laws. The court, however, did affirm the rights of same-sex couples to enjoy equal benefits similar to those of live-in partners under Article 21 (Right to Life) of the Constitution.</p>
        
        <h3>Global Status on Recognition of Same-Sex Marriage</h3>
        <p>As of 2024, over 30 countries worldwide, including the US, Canada, Australia, and France, have legalized same-sex marriages. The Netherlands was the first country to do so in 2001, and Taiwan became the first Asian nation to legalize it.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>However, in certain countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Brunei, same-sex marriages are criminalized, with severe penalties, including death or corporal punishment, for those involved.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>What is the Special Marriage Act (SMA), 1954?</h3>
        <p>The Special Marriage Act provides a framework for civil marriages between individuals of different faiths or castes in India. It applies to individuals from all religious backgrounds and facilitates the legal recognition of their marriage.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Provisions of SMA</h3>
        <p>The SMA mandates certain requirements for marriage registration, including notice submission, objections handling, and age limits (21 for men, 18 for women). While it allows for civil marriages, it does not extend to same-sex couples.</p>
        
        <h3>Arguments in Favor of Same-Sex Marriage</h3>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Equality and Human Rights:</strong> Denying same-sex couples the right to marry is seen as a violation of fundamental rights. Advocates argue that it is a step backward in ensuring equality under the law, as guaranteed in both international human rights conventions and India's Constitution.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Arguments Against Same-Sex Marriage</h3>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Religious and Cultural Beliefs:</strong> Many religious groups argue that marriage should remain between a man and a woman, asserting that same-sex marriages undermine traditional cultural and religious values.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>LGBTQIA+ Rights in India</h3>
        <p>The LGBTQIA+ community in India has made significant strides over the years. Notably, the Supreme Court recognized transgender individuals as a third gender in 2014, decriminalized same-sex relationships in 2018, and expanded the definition of family to include same-sex couples in 2022.</p>
        
        <h3>Way Forward</h3>
        <p>The road to legalizing same-sex marriage in India remains complex. Legal reforms, dialogue between cultural and religious leaders, and judicial activism are key to ensuring equal rights for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While the Supreme Court's ruling rejects the immediate legal recognition of same-sex marriage, the ongoing societal debate, legal reforms, and judicial activism offer hope for future recognition of these unions in India.</p>
