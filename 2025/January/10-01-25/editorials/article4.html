        Misuse of Section 152 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita
    </header>

    <section>
        <img src="title-image.jpg" alt="Misuse of Section 152 of BNS">

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In the recent case of <strong>Tejender Pal Singh v. State of Rajasthan (2024)</strong>, the Rajasthan High Court raised alarms about the potential misuse of Section 152 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). This legal provision seeks to criminalize actions that may endanger India's sovereignty, unity, and integrity. The law, however, has sparked a debate about its scope, its potential for misuse, and its impact on free speech. This article delves into these issues, offering a critical analysis of the law, its implications for civil liberties, and the need for reform.
        </p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Section 152 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita is part of India's criminal code aimed at addressing acts of secession, rebellion, and subversive activities. The law criminalizes actions that threaten India's unity and integrity. While its purpose is to safeguard the nation, the Rajasthan High Court's ruling in the Tejender Pal Singh case highlighted the law’s potential for abuse, particularly in stifling legitimate dissent and restricting free speech.
        </p>

        <h3>Problems with Section 152</h3>

        <h4>Vagueness in Definition</h4>
        <p>
            One of the primary concerns with Section 152 is the lack of clarity in defining key terms such as “sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.” This vagueness allows for broad interpretations by authorities, leading to overreach. The ambiguity surrounding these terms can easily result in the criminalization of speech or actions that do not necessarily threaten national security but could be perceived as dissent or opposition.
        </p>

        <h4>Lower Threshold for Offence</h4>
        <p>
            The term “knowingly” lowers the threshold for prosecution under Section 152. As a result, individuals who share content online, even without intending to incite violence or rebellion, could be prosecuted under this law. Moreover, the fact that Section 152 is cognizable and non-bailable raises concerns about wrongful arrests and long periods of detention for individuals whose actions are not inherently criminal.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            Past data shows the misuse of sedition laws: between 2015 and 2020, there were 548 arrests under Section 124A IPC, but only 12 convictions were made. Section 152, being broader than Section 124A, may lead to an even greater number of wrongful arrests and prosecutions.
        </div>

        <h4>Chilling Effect on Free Speech</h4>
        <p>
            Section 152’s provisions can have a chilling effect on free speech, especially in the digital age. The absence of a requirement to demonstrate a direct causal link between speech and its consequences means that individuals may face punishment for expressing opinions or sharing content without it leading to any actual harm. This creates an environment where people may hesitate to speak freely for fear of legal repercussions.
        </p>

        <h3>Judicial Precedents on Free Speech</h3>
        <p>
            Several judicial precedents have shed light on the balance between free speech and national security. In the case of <strong>Balwant Singh v. State of Punjab (1995)</strong>, the Supreme Court distinguished between casual sloganeering and actual acts of rebellion. In <strong>Javed Ahmad Hazam v. State of Maharashtra (2024)</strong>, the Court emphasized that the impact of words should be assessed from the perspective of reasonable, strong-minded individuals, not those who may overreact. Similarly, in <strong>Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar (1962)</strong>, the Court drew a distinction between strong criticism of government policies and disloyalty to the state.
        </p>

        <h3>Way Forward</h3>
        <p>
            In light of these concerns, there is a growing call for the Supreme Court to issue clear guidelines for interpreting Section 152, similar to the directives it issued in <strong>D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal</strong> regarding arrests. The guidelines should include a requirement for authorities to establish a direct causal connection between speech and its consequences, ensuring that Section 152 is not used to target peaceful dissent. Additionally, safeguards must be put in place to prevent the misuse of the law, particularly in politically sensitive contexts.
        </p>

        <div class="important">
            Liberal space for thoughts and expressions is crucial in a democratic society, particularly with the rise of social media platforms. The “marketplace of ideas” theory, envisioned by Justice Holmes in <strong>Abrams v. United States</strong>, underscores the importance of open debate for the emergence of truth.
        </div>

        <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Section 152 of the BNS, while aimed at safeguarding India’s sovereignty, poses significant challenges to the protection of free speech and civil liberties. The vagueness of its provisions and the broad scope of its application have led to concerns about misuse, particularly in the context of political dissent. As India continues to grapple with the balance between security and individual freedoms, it is essential to ensure that laws such as Section 152 are interpreted in a manner that protects the rights of citizens while maintaining national security.
