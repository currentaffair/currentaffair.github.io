<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) scheme was launched to provide quality education to Scheduled Tribe (ST) students in remote areas. However, despite significant budgetary allocations and efforts, a third of the 716 approved EMRS remain non-functional. This issue is compounded by high dropout rates, particularly among Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), revealing persistent challenges in providing equitable education to tribal communities. The following sections explore these issues, their causes, and potential solutions.</p>
<h2>Key Issues with EMRS</h2>
<h3>1. Infrastructure Gaps</h3>
<p>One of the primary challenges faced by EMRS is poor infrastructure. Approximately 240 schools are non-functional due to land issues, lack of hostels, and absence of basic amenities. Many functional schools still lack essential facilities like drinking water, electricity, functional toilets, and internet access. Only 53.9% of schools have internet access, limiting the effectiveness of modern learning tools.</p>
<h3>2. Teacher Shortages and Retention Issues</h3>
<p>There is an acute shortage of teachers, particularly subject specialists. Many teachers are recruited on a contractual or deputation basis, leading to inconsistency in the quality of education. The lack of local recruitment results in language barriers, as many teachers are unfamiliar with the local tribal dialects.</p>
<h3>3. High Dropout Rates Among PVTGs</h3>
<p>The dropout rate is notably high among students from PVTGs. By the time students reach Class VII, dropout rates surge, with only half the students enrolled in Class XII compared to Class VI. In states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Chhattisgarh, the enrolment of PVTGs remains far below the 5% quota allocated to them. Economic pressures often force children to engage in daily wage work, making education less of a priority.</p>
<h3>4. Socio-Economic Barriers</h3>
<p>Tribal students face extreme poverty, landlessness, and migration for work, all of which affect their ability to attend school regularly. Additionally, illiterate parents often struggle to support their children's education, and the lack of awareness about the importance of education further hinders enrolment and retention.</p>

<h2>Reasons Behind the Dropout Rates</h2>
<h3>1. Economic Pressures</h3>
<p>Poverty and seasonal migration force many tribal children to work instead of attending school, disrupting their academic continuity and contributing significantly to dropout rates.</p>
<h3>2. Language Barriers</h3>
<p>The bilingual medium of instruction (regional language and English) proves challenging for tribal students who are not familiar with either language. Teachersâ€™ unfamiliarity with local dialects exacerbates this issue, leading to poor communication and comprehension.</p>
<h3>3. Entrance Exam Challenges</h3>
<p>Admission to EMRS is based on competitive exams that many PVTG students struggle to clear. The lack of preparatory resources further disadvantages these students, making it difficult for them to secure a place in these schools.</p>
<h2>Policy Gaps and Governance Issues</h2>
<h3>1. Ineffective Implementation of PVTG Quota</h3>
<p>The 5% quota for PVTGs in EMRS has not been fully utilized, particularly in states
