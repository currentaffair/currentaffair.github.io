<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The 8th edition of the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) was launched in New Delhi, marking a significant step in India's journey towards enhancing its organic farming sector. The Union Minister of Commerce &amp; Industry projected that India’s organic farming exports could reach ₹20,000 crore in the next three years. This launch emphasizes India's potential as a key player in global organic farming markets.</p>
<h2>What is the National Programme for Organic Production?</h2>
<p>The NPOP, initiated in 2001, is a comprehensive framework for accreditation, certification, and promoting organic farming practices across India. Managed by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), the programme ensures that Indian organic products meet international standards. Through NPOP, India’s organic products gain recognition globally, notably in Europe and Switzerland, making it easier for Indian farmers to access international markets.</p>
<h3>Key Highlights of the 8th Edition NPOP</h3>
<p>During the 8th edition of the NPOP event, several initiatives aimed at enhancing the organic farming ecosystem were highlighted. Key technological advancements include the NPOP Portal, Organic Promotion Portal, TraceNet 2.0, and the AgriXchange Portal. These platforms are designed to streamline operations, increase transparency, and connect farmers with global buyers.</p>

<h2>What is Organic Farming?</h2>
<p>Organic farming focuses on the health of soils, ecosystems, and human beings by avoiding synthetic chemicals and emphasizing natural processes. It incorporates ecological cycles and biodiversity, blending tradition, innovation, and science. This farming practice aims to promote environmental sustainability while maintaining fair relationships with stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Status of Organic Farming in India</h3>
<p>India ranks second globally in organic agricultural land. Sikkim, India’s first fully organic state, has set a precedent for the rest of the nation. As of the latest data, around 4.5 million hectares (2.5% of the country’s total agricultural land) are under organic certification. The major states contributing to India’s organic farming include Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan.</p>
<h2>Challenges in Organic Farming in India</h2>
<p>Despite the rapid growth of organic farming, there are several challenges faced by Indian farmers. These include high certification costs, lack of adequate infrastructure, limited market access, and climate-related issues. Moreover, many small-scale farmers are deterred by the expensive certification processes, while the competition from cheaper conventional products further affects the viability of organic farming.</p>
<h3>Way Forward</h3>
<p>To address these challenges, various steps need to be taken, including simplifying certification processes, strengthening market linkages, increasing investment in research and development, and enhancing consumer awareness. Policies that offer financial aid during the transition from conventional to organic farming, as well as those that create direct market linkages, will also play a key role in promoting organic farming.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The NPOP has provided a much-needed platform to support India’s organic farming sector, fostering sustainability, transparency, and global competitiveness. Moving forward, focused efforts on addressing the challenges of certification, infrastructure, market access, and consumer awareness will help establish India as a global leader in organic farming.</p>
