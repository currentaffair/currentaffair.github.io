    Supreme Court Judgment on Accessibility Guidelines for Persons with Disabilities
</header>

<section>
    <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Supreme Court Judgment Image">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Rajive Raturi v. Union of India (2024) has significant implications for the accessibility rights of persons with disabilities. The court found that Rule 15 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Rules, 2017, was in violation of the mandatory provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPwD Act), 2016. This judgment compels the government to revise the existing accessibility guidelines, particularly with a focus on the mandatory aspects of the accessibility provisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Background of the Case</h2>
    <p>
        The Supreme Court examined the legal discrepancies between Rule 15 of the RPwD Rules and the core mandates laid out in the RPwD Act. Rule 15 was found to use discretionary language, while the Act itself imposes mandatory obligations on the government. The Court's ruling invalidated Rule 15, which had undermined the statutory authority of the existing accessibility guidelines.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Relevant Sections of the RPwD Act</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Section 40: Accessibility standards for public buildings, services, etc.</li>
        <li>Section 44: Accessibility in transport.</li>
        <li>Section 45: Accessibility in information and communication technology.</li>
        <li>Section 46: Accessibility in various services and facilities.</li>
        <li>Section 89: Power of the government to make rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Issues with the Existing Guidelines</h2>
    <h3>Discretionary Nature of Existing Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        The primary issue with the existing accessibility guidelines was their discretionary nature. They allowed different ministries and departments to interpret and implement accessibility measures based on their discretion, which was contrary to the mandatory provisions of the RPwD Act. This lack of uniformity in approach led to fragmented policies and inconsistent enforcement.
    </p>

    <h3>Fragmentation of Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        Various departments created accessibility guidelines independently, without a unified framework. This fragmentation further hindered the effective implementation of accessibility measures, leaving many areas without proper guidelines or support.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessibility vs. Reasonable Accommodation</h2>
    <p class="highlight">
        Accessibility is a universal right embedded in international law, particularly the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It focuses on creating environments that are inherently accessible to everyone, including persons with disabilities, from the outset. In contrast, reasonable accommodation refers to modifications made to specific situations to address the unique challenges faced by individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both concepts are complementary. Accessibility lays the foundation for inclusivity, while reasonable accommodation ensures that individuals can participate fully, even when the environment presents challenges.
    </p>

    <h2>Evolving Concepts of Accessibility</h2>
    <h3>Technological Developments and Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
        With the advancement of technology, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), the concept of accessibility has evolved. Today, digital accessibility tools are dynamic and adaptive, offering solutions tailored to individual needs. These tools make it easier for persons with disabilities to navigate both digital and physical environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Phased Realization of Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
        The Court observed that while existing guidelines set long-term accessibility goals, they lacked immediate minimum standards. A phased realization approach, similar to Canadaâ€™s roadmap for achieving full accessibility by 2040, could be more effective. A sliding scale approach could be implemented to gradually improve accessibility while meeting immediate needs.
    </p>

    <h2>Addressing Barriers to Accessibility</h2>
    <h3>Tangible vs. Intangible Barriers</h3>
    <p>
        Barriers to accessibility can be both tangible (physical infrastructure) and intangible (societal attitudes). Effective accessibility guidelines should address both types of barriers to ensure that all persons with disabilities can participate fully in society.
    </p>

    <h2>Universal Design and Inclusivity</h2>
    <p>
        Universal design principles should not only benefit persons with disabilities but also other vulnerable groups such as women, children, and the elderly. The scope of universal design should be expanded to create environments that are accessible to all, regardless of age or ability.
    </p>

    <h2>Compliance Through Social Audits</h2>
    <p>
        Section 48 of the RPwD Act mandates social audits of schemes to ensure their effectiveness in addressing the needs of persons with disabilities. However, there are challenges in implementing these audits, including a lack of standardized guidelines and the need for increased training of auditors.
    </p>

    <h2>Simplifying Accessibility Rules</h2>
    <p>
        The current accessibility rules are bureaucratically complex, with overlapping mandates from multiple ministries. This creates confusion and increases compliance costs. A simpler, more direct approach is needed, with a central authority overseeing the guidelines and ensuring consistency across sectors.
    </p>

    <h2>Deadline for New Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        The government is expected to issue new accessibility guidelines by February 2025. These guidelines must
