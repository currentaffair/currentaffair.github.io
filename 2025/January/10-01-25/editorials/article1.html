    Eklavya Model Residential Schools: Challenges and Solutions
</header>

<section>
    <img src="eklavya-schools.jpg" alt="Eklavya Model Residential Schools">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) scheme was launched with the aim to provide quality education to Scheduled Tribe (ST) students, especially those in remote areas. Despite substantial efforts and budgetary allocations, a significant proportion of EMRS remain non-functional. This article delves into the challenges faced by these schools, the dropout rates among tribal communities, and potential solutions to enhance their effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The EMRS program was designed to ensure that students from Tribal communities receive education from Class VI to XII. The plan was set into motion with the objective of bringing education to remote regions, where access to quality schooling was limited. However, the scheme faces several challenges that need urgent attention to meet its goals.</p>

    <h3>Challenges Faced by Eklavya Model Schools</h3>
    <section>
        <h3>Infrastructure Gaps</h3>
        <p>One of the key issues with EMRS is the lack of adequate infrastructure. As per reports, over 240 of the approved schools remain non-functional due to land acquisition issues, absence of hostels, and lack of basic facilities. Additionally, many schools do not have access to essential utilities such as clean drinking water, electricity, and functional toilets. Notably, only 53.9% of EMRS have internet access, limiting the usage of modern educational tools. Without basic amenities, students cannot receive a quality education.</p>
        
        <h3>Teacher Shortages</h3>
        <p>Another major problem is the shortage of qualified teachers. EMRS struggle with a lack of subject specialists, and many of the teachers who are recruited are on a contract or deputation basis, leading to inconsistency in teaching quality. Furthermore, teachers are often unfamiliar with the local tribal languages, creating significant communication barriers. Local recruitment, though proposed, has yet to gain traction, contributing to this issue.</p>
        
        <h3>High Dropout Rates</h3>
        <p>The dropout rate in EMRS is alarmingly high, especially among Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Many students drop out between Class VII and XII, with only about half of the students who begin in Class VI continuing through to Class XII. In states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Chhattisgarh, the enrolment of PVTG students is significantly lower than the 5% quota reserved for them. Economic pressures, seasonal migration, and the lack of a consistent educational environment often force tribal children to leave school and work instead.</p>

        <h3>Socio-Economic Barriers</h3>
        <p>PVTGs face extreme poverty, landlessness, and migration for work, which disrupts their academic progress. Additionally, many parents are illiterate and do not fully understand the importance of education, further discouraging enrolment. This socio-economic context poses significant challenges to the EMRS initiative.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Reasons Behind the Dropout Rates</h3>
    <section>
        <h3>Economic Pressures</h3>
        <p>Poverty and seasonal migration force many tribal children to engage in work, which disrupts their education. This economic necessity often outweighs the desire or ability to continue formal schooling.</p>
        
        <h3>Language Barriers</h3>
        <p>The medium of instruction in most EMRS is bilingual, using both regional languages and English. This language barrier, coupled with teachersâ€™ unfamiliarity with local dialects, makes comprehension difficult for students, hindering their educational progress.</p>

        <h3>Entrance Exam Challenges</h3>
        <p>Admission to EMRS is contingent upon passing competitive exams, which many PVTG students find difficult to clear due to a lack of preparatory resources. This systemic challenge disadvantages these students in comparison to other tribal students.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Policy Gaps and Governance Issues</h3>
    <section>
        <h3>Ineffective Implementation of PVTG Quota</h3>
        <p>Despite the 5% reservation for PVTGs in EMRS, this quota remains largely underutilized. States like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Chhattisgarh have failed to meet the minimum quota, further reducing opportunities for these vulnerable groups.</p>
        
        <h3>Lack of Monitoring and Accountability</h3>
        <p>The National Educational Society for Tribal Students (NESTS), established in 2019, has not been able to adequately oversee the implementation of the EMRS program. State-level coordination remains poor, with little reporting on school performance and enrolment data.</p>
        
        <h3>Budget Utilization Issues</h3>
        <p>While the government has increased funding for tribal welfare, these funds are often underutilized due to inefficient execution. The Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and other related initiatives have not sufficiently addressed the gaps in secondary and higher secondary education for tribal children.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
    <section>
        <h3>Improving Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>Before approving new EMRS, the focus should be on improving the existing infrastructure, ensuring all schools have access to clean drinking water, electricity, and internet facilities.
