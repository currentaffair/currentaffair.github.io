<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Rajasthan High Court, in <i>Tejender Pal Singh v. State of Rajasthan (2024)</i>, cautioned against using Section 152 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) as a tool to stifle legitimate dissent. Section 152, enacted as part of the BNS, criminalises actions that endanger the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India. Despite not formally using the term 'sedition', the provision shares significant similarities with earlier sedition laws, raising concerns about its potential misuse.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Before the enactment of the BNS, the Supreme Court had suspended pending criminal trials under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). This decision followed a proclamation from the Union Home Minister that the offence of 'sedition' would be repealed. However, Section 152 of the BNS still carries significant legal implications, criminalising acts that could be construed as endangering national unity.</p>
<h2>Problems with Section 152</h2>
<h3>Vagueness and Ambiguity</h3>
<p>One of the most critical issues with Section 152 is its vagueness. The statute criminalises 'acts endangering the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India', but does not define what constitutes such an endangerment. This lack of specificity leaves the provision open to broad interpretation. A speech criticising a prominent political figure, for example, could be interpreted as endangering national unity, leading to potential legal consequences. This makes it susceptible to abuse, particularly in today's politically fragmented environment.</p>
<h3>Implications of ‘Knowingly’</h3>
<p>The inclusion of the word 'knowingly' in Section 152 significantly lowers the threshold for liability, especially in the age of social media. A person who shares a post without malicious intent could still be prosecuted if it is deemed that they 'knowingly' shared content that could provoke illegal activities. This provision, being cognisable and non-bailable, may lead to arrests without establishing a direct causal link between speech and its consequences, thus stifling free speech.</p>
<h3>Potential for Abuse</h3>
<p>The potential for misuse of Section 152 is evident in historical data related to the misuse of Section 124A (sedition) under the IPC. Between 2015 and 2020, 548 people were arrested for sedition, but only 12 were convicted, which highlights the inefficiency and abuse of the law. Despite these figures, the BNS has adopted even broader and less defined language, increasing the risk of misuse.</p>
<h2>The Way Forward</h2>
<h3>Judiciary’s Consequentialist Interpretation</h3>
<p>The judiciary has historically taken a consequentialist approach in balancing national security concerns with the freedom of expression. The Supreme Court has required a clear causal connection between speech and its impact to justify the charge of sedition. This approach was evident in cases like <i>Balwant Singh v. State of Punjab (1995)</i>, where the court distinguished between casual speech and its actual consequences. Similar interpretations should be applied to Section 152 to prevent arbitrary action.</p>
<h3>Guidelines for Enforcement Authorities</h3>
<p>Given the potential for misuse, the Supreme Court should craft guidelines to clarify the terms and scope of Section 152, much like it did with ‘arrest’ in the <i>D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal</i> case. These guidelines would provide enforcement authorities with clearer boundaries, reducing the likelihood of overreach and ensuring that Section 152 does not become a tool for political suppression.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In a democratic society, it is essential to protect the right to dissent and criticism. The concept of a 'marketplace of ideas' allows diverse views to be debated freely. In the age of social media, however, it is crucial to ensure that laws like Section 152 are used cautiously, ensuring that they do not infringe upon the fundamental right to free expression.</p>
