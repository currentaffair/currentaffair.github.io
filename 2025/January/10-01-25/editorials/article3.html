    Supreme Court Judgment in Rajive Raturi v. Union of India (2024)
</header>
<section>
<img alt="Court Case Image" src="https://www.livelaw.in/h-upload/2023/11/29/506875-1600x960395678-sign-board-and-sc.jpg"/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Rajive Raturi v. Union of India case holds significant implications for the accessibility of public services and infrastructure for persons with disabilities in India. The Court struck down Rule 15 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Rules, 2017, deeming it inconsistent with the mandatory provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. This ruling highlights the need for a more robust, mandatory framework to ensure universal accessibility.</p>
<h3>Case Context</h3>
<p>In this landmark decision, the Supreme Court held that Rule 15 of the RPwD Rules was inconsistent with the mandatory provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016. The rule provided discretionary guidelines on accessibility, whereas the Act mandated specific obligations. The judgment invalidated the statutory authority of the existing accessibility guidelines and instructed the government to come up with a more definitive, mandatory framework within three months.</p>
<h3>Key Sections of the RPwD Act Referenced</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 40</strong>: Accessibility standards for public buildings, services, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Section 44</strong>: Accessibility in transport.</li>
<li><strong>Section 45</strong>: Accessibility in information and communication technology.</li>
<li><strong>Section 46</strong>: Accessibility in various services and facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Section 89</strong>: Power of the government to make rules.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Issues with the Existing Guidelines</h2>
<p>Despite the noble intentions of the existing guidelines, several issues were identified that undermined their effectiveness. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discretionary Nature</strong>: The guidelines allowed ministries and departments discretionary power, deviating from the mandatory obligations of the Act.</li>
<li><strong>Fragmentation</strong>: Guidelines were created in silos by various departments, resulting in a lack of a unified accessibility framework.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accessibility vs. Reasonable Accommodation</h3>
<p>The Court recognized the difference between accessibility as a universal right and reasonable accommodation, which addresses individual needs. While accessibility focuses on creating universally accessible environments, reasonable accommodation offers tailored solutions. Both are necessary for creating an inclusive society.</p>
<h3>Technological Evolution and Phased Realization</h3>
<p>The evolution of digital accessibility, with advancements like AI and IoT, requires the creation of adaptive, dynamic accessibility solutions. The Court emphasized that current guidelines set long-term goals without specifying immediate minimum standards. It suggested adopting a phased approach, such as Canada’s roadmap for full accessibility by 2040, where the minimum standards would be periodically updated.</p>
<h2>Barriers to Accessibility</h2>
<h3>Tangible vs. Intangible Barriers</h3>
<p>The Court highlighted that accessibility guidelines should address both tangible barriers, such as physical infrastructure, and intangible barriers, like attitudinal perceptions. A truly inclusive framework must overcome both types of barriers.</p>
<h3>Universal Design and Inclusivity</h3>
<p>Universal design principles should not only benefit persons with disabilities but also vulnerable groups like women, children, and the elderly. The Court argued that disability should be viewed as a result of environmental factors rather than an individual’s incapacity.</p>
<h2>Compliance Through Social Audits</h2>
<p>Section 48 of the RPwD Act mandates social audits of schemes to ensure they meet the needs of persons with disabilities. However, challenges such as the lack of standardized audit guidelines and inconsistent implementation across states pose barriers to effective compliance.</p>
<h2>Simplifying Accessibility Rules</h2>
<h3>Current Issues</h3>
<p>The existing accessibility rules are bureaucratically complex and suffer from overlapping mandates across ministries, which has created confusion and increased compliance costs. For instance, sporting complexes have faced conflicting guidelines from various ministries.</p>
<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
<p>The new rules should be clear, practical, and understandable. A nodal authority, ideally the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, should be established to adjudicate and streamline the rules for easier compliance.</p>
<h3>Deadline for New Guidelines</h3>
<p>The government is expected to formulate the new accessibility guidelines by February 2025. These guidelines must not only apply to public services but also to the private sector, including industries like finance, technology, and transport. By doing so, they can tap into an underserved population and unlock significant market potential.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court’s judgment has sent a clear message about the need for robust, mandatory accessibility frameworks for persons with disabilities. The government now faces the challenge of formulating new, practical, and comprehensive accessibility guidelines that address both tangible and intangible barriers while considering technological developments. It is crucial that the new rules are well-structured, simple to understand, and easily applicable across various sectors, ensuring a more inclusive society.</p>
