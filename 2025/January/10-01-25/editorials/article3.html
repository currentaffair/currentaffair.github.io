    Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS): Challenges and Solutions
</header>

<section>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) scheme was launched with the aim of providing quality education to Scheduled Tribe (ST) students, particularly in remote areas of India. While the initiative has made strides in improving access to education, there are significant challenges hindering its full potential. This article delves into the issues faced by EMRS, including infrastructure gaps, teacher shortages, and high dropout rates among students, especially from Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). It also explores potential solutions to address these problems and enhance the effectiveness of the scheme.</p>

    <h2>Key Issues Facing EMRS</h2>

    <h3>1. Infrastructure Gaps</h3>
    <p>One of the most pressing issues faced by EMRS is inadequate infrastructure. A substantial number of the 716 approved schools remain non-functional due to land acquisition problems, lack of necessary facilities like hostels, and other basic infrastructure requirements. According to the latest data, 240 schools are non-functional. Additionally, many of the existing schools lack essential amenities such as drinking water, electricity, and functional toilets. Only 53.9% of schools currently have internet access, which restricts the ability to integrate modern learning tools that could enhance the education experience.</p>

    <h3>2. Teacher Shortages and Retention Issues</h3>
    <p>EMRS faces significant challenges with teacher recruitment and retention. The shortage of qualified subject specialists is a key concern, as many teachers are recruited on a contractual or deputation basis. This leads to a lack of consistency in the quality of teaching. Furthermore, the lack of local recruitment leads to communication barriers, as teachers are often unfamiliar with the tribal dialects spoken by students, making it difficult for students to fully grasp the lessons being taught.</p>

    <h3>3. High Dropout Rates Among PVTGs</h3>
    <p>Dropout rates in EMRS are disproportionately high, especially among students from PVTGs. These dropout rates increase as students progress through the grades. For instance, the number of students enrolled in Class VI is much higher than in Class XII, with many students dropping out between Classes VII and XI. This issue is particularly pronounced in states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Chhattisgarh, where the enrolment of PVTGs is significantly below the 5% quota allocated for them. The economic pressures faced by many tribal families often force children to take up work, leaving little time for education.</p>

    <h3>4. Socio-Economic Barriers</h3>
    <p>Many tribal communities, especially those from PVTGs, experience extreme poverty, landlessness, and migration for work. These socio-economic challenges make regular school attendance difficult. Additionally, many parents are illiterate or unaware of the importance of education, leading to lower enrollment rates. This socio-economic backdrop significantly affects the educational continuity of tribal children.</p>

    <h2>Reasons Behind the Dropout Rates</h2>

    <h3>1. Economic Pressures</h3>
    <p>Poverty and seasonal migration are key contributors to the high dropout rates. Many tribal children are forced to work to support their families, thereby disrupting their education. The lack of financial resources makes it difficult for these students to continue their studies.</p>

    <h3>2. Language Barriers</h3>
    <p>The medium of instruction in EMRS is often bilingual, with regional languages and English being used. This creates difficulties for students from tribal communities, as they are not always fluent in the regional languages or in English. Moreover, teachers are not always proficient in tribal dialects, which further exacerbates the language barrier.</p>

    <h3>3. Entrance Exam Challenges</h3>
    <p>Admission to EMRS is based on competitive exams, which are often difficult for PVTG students to clear. The lack of preparatory resources puts them at a significant disadvantage compared to other students. A more inclusive entrance process could help address this issue.</p>

    <h2>Policy Gaps and Governance Issues</h2>

    <h3>1. Ineffective Implementation of PVTG Quota</h3>
    <p>The 5% quota allocated for PVTG students in EMRS remains underutilized in most states. States like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Chhattisgarh have failed to achieve even half of the allocated quota, highlighting the inefficiency in policy implementation.</p>

    <h3>2. Lack of Monitoring and Accountability</h3>
    <p>The National Educational Society for Tribal Students (NESTS), set up in 2019, has limited capacity to oversee the functioning of EMRS. There is poor coordination at the state level, and inconsistent reporting on school performance and enrollment data further hampers accountability.</p>

    <h3>3. Budget Utilization and Allocation</h3>
    <p>While budget allocations for tribal welfare have increased, the funds allocated for EMRS and related schemes are often underutilized due to poor execution. The Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and other schemes have not adequately addressed the gaps in secondary
