<img alt="National Anthem Image" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1600x320"/>
<h2>Why in News?</h2>
<p>The Governor of Tamil Nadu left the Legislative Assembly without delivering his customary address due to non-playing of the National Anthem, triggering a dispute over state legislature practices.</p>
<h2>National Anthem &amp; National Song</h2>
<p><strong>National Anthem:</strong> Jana-gana-mana, composed by Rabindranath Tagore in 1911, was adopted in Hindi. It was first sung at the 1911 Calcutta Session of the INC.</p>
<p><strong>National Song:</strong> Vande Mataram, written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, first sung at the 1896 INC session. Both were adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 24th January 1950.</p>
<h2>Protocols and Conventions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presidential Address:</strong> National Anthem played as President reaches the dais and as they exit.</li>
<li><strong>Governor’s Address:</strong> Different states follow different practices; for example, Tamil Nadu plays State Anthem before the Governor’s address and the National Anthem after.</li>
</ul>
<h2>National Anthem in Cinemas</h2>
<p>In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the playing of the National Anthem in cinemas is optional, not mandatory.</p>
<h2>Safeguards to Protect the Honour of the National Anthem</h2>
<p><strong>Constitutional Perspective:</strong> Section 51 (A) (a) mandates respect for the National Anthem.</p>
<p><strong>PINH Act, 1971:</strong> Punishment for disrespecting the anthem, including imprisonment for up to 3 years.</p>
<p><strong>MHA Guidelines:</strong> Mandate the full National Anthem during formal functions and military parades.</p>
