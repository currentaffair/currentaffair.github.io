<h2>Why in News?</h2>
<p>At least 2 fatalities have been reported, and 70,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate due to massive wildfires in California.</p>

<li><strong>Hurst Fire:</strong> 500 acres burned in Sylmar, northwest of Los Angeles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges in Firefighting Efforts</h2>
<p>Fierce winds hinder firefighting efforts, and all three fires remain 0% contained. Significant injuries have been reported among residents who ignored evacuation orders.</p>
<h2>Government Response</h2>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency. President Joe Biden is expected to visit a fire station for a briefing from fire officials. Emergency responders are conducting door-to-door evacuations.</p>
