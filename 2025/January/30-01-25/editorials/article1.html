<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>India's White Revolution, led by Verghese Kurien, catapulted the country into the position of the world's largest milk producer. However, despite the remarkable success on the supply side, the focus now must shift to ensuring that milk reaches the most vulnerable sections of society, addressing deep disparities in its consumption across different socio-economic groups and regions. As the Union Budget 2025-26 approaches, prioritizing equitable milk access is crucial to improve health outcomes for all.</p>

<h2>Milk Consumption Disparities</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p>The latest Household Consumer Expenditure Surveys (HCES) by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) reveal significant disparities in milk consumption between the highest and lowest income groups. Households in the top-income decile consume three to four times more milk per capita than those in the lowest-income decile. Despite efforts to increase consumption among lower-income groups, the poorest 30% consume only 18% of India's total milk supply.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Limitations of NSSO Survey:</strong> The NSSO primarily measures at-home consumption, which accounts for only about 50% of India's total milk production. Out-of-home milk consumption, such as in restaurants and hotels, is not sufficiently captured, which likely exacerbates the disparities in consumption.</p>
</div>

<h2>Regional, Social, and Urban-Rural Divides</h2>
<p>There are notable regional and social differences in milk consumption across India. Urban households consume approximately 30% more milk per capita than rural households, despite the majority of milk being produced in rural areas. Furthermore, Scheduled Tribe households consume about four litres less milk per capita compared to general category households.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<h3>Regional Consumption Variations</h3>
<p>In states like Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana, the average daily per capita milk consumption at home ranges from 333 grams to 421 grams. In contrast, eastern states such as Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and West Bengal consume only between 75 grams to 171 grams per capita daily.</p>

<h2>Focus on Vulnerable Groups</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p>Several factors contribute to disparities in milk consumption, including dietary preferences, lactose intolerance, and affordability. The National Institute of Nutrition recommends 300 grams of milk daily for an average sedentary adult. However, meeting this requirement would force 70% of Indian households to allocate 10% to 30% of their monthly expenditures on milk, which many cannot afford.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Affluent Urban Households:</strong> On the other hand, affluent urban households tend to consume more than double the recommended levels of milk, including high-fat and high-sugar products such as ice cream and packaged milk-based sweets. This raises concerns about overnutrition, obesity, and non-communicable diseases, which are on the rise among these populations.</p>

<h2>Prioritizing Milk Access for Vulnerable Groups</h2>
<p>To ensure that milk reaches the most vulnerable populations, prioritization is necessary. This includes enhancing milk provision for young children, pregnant and lactating women, and the elderly in low-income settings. Existing schemes such as POSHAN, Integrated Child Development Services meals, and take-home rations should be bolstered. States like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Telangana are already providing milk, but the quantities remain insufficient. Further boosting financial allocations to these programs could yield substantial health benefits.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Innovative Financing Options:</strong> Governments can explore alternative funding sources such as social bonds, corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding, and increased taxes on unhealthy foods. Additionally, milk coupons in regions with strong market access and dairy cooperative networks could help enhance access, lower distribution costs, and boost local milk markets.</p>

<h2>Raising Awareness and Nutrition Benefits</h2>
<p>A key part of improving milk access is increasing awareness about its nutritional benefits. Targeted campaigns should focus on educating women through Anganwadi centers, doctors, and self-help groups. Maharashtra and Bihar are leaders in organizing grassroots activities to promote nutrition awareness, as seen in Poshan Maah 2024. Research shows that improved nutrition awareness among women significantly enhances household dietary diversity.</p>

<h2>The U.K. Model for Healthy Consumption</h2>
<p>International examples, such as the U.K.'s Change4Life Sugar Swaps campaign, provide valuable lessons for India. The campaign effectively reduced sugar and fat consumption by promoting healthier alternatives. A similar approach in India could focus on reducing overconsumption of milk products in affluent communities while promoting more balanced and nutritious diets. Furthermore, it could help mitigate the rise of overnutrition and ensure milk remains affordable for vulnerable groups.</p>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Milk plays a critical role in ensuring nutrition security in India. Achieving equitable access for vulnerable populations while moderating overconsumption among the affluent is key to fulfilling the vision of a nutritionally secure India. By enhancing access for the most vulnerable and addressing overnutrition in affluent areas, the benefits of the White Revolution can be made available to all.</p>
