<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The debate over poverty stems from varying data methodologies and poverty lines, highlighting the need for standardized assessment methods.</p>
<h2>What is Poverty?</h2>
<p>Poverty is when individuals or communities lack the financial resources to meet basic needs like food, shelter, water, and healthcare.</p>
<h2>Standard Methods of Measuring Poverty</h2>
<p>Absolute poverty uses a fixed standard, defining poverty by the inability to meet essential needs. In India, the Tendulkar Committee previously set the poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure. However, it was criticized for overlooking poverty's multidimensional aspects.</p>
<h2>Relative Poverty</h2>
<p>Relative poverty compares individuals or groups against others within society, assessing their standard of living in relation to the overall population.</p>
