<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Prof. Vishvajit Pandya, Director of ANTRI, presented key findings about the Shompens, an isolated aboriginal community from Great Nicobar Island.</p>
<h2>The Shompens</h2>
<p>The Shompens, one of the most isolated tribes on Earth, live in the dense rainforests of Great Nicobar Island. They have Mongoloid ancestry and speak multiple dialects, often leading to communication challenges.</p>
<h2>Habitat and Lifestyle</h2>
<p>They live a nomadic lifestyle, establishing temporary camps in the forests. Their diet consists mainly of rainforest plants, particularly Pandanus fruit, and they grow small gardens with lemons and betel.</p>
<h2>Social Structure</h2>
<p>The Shompens live in nuclear families with patriarchal control. Monogamy is common, though polygamy is allowed. They worship the moon as their goddess, who is believed to have created the universe.</p>
<h2>ANTRIâ€™s Role</h2>
<p>ANTRI is dedicated to studying tribal communities, preserving cultural heritage, and providing inputs for evidence-based planning and legislation related to tribal affairs.</p>
