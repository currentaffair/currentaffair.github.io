<h2>Pangsau Pass</h2>

It holds historical significance, having been a key route for the Shan tribe’s invasion into Assam in the 13th century and a crucial obstacle for General Stilwell’s road-building effort during WWII. The pass is also known as "Hell Pass" due to the tough terrain and is famous for the "Lake of No Return" visible from its summit.</p>
<h2>Pangsau Pass International Festival</h2>

<h2>Important Passes in India</h2>
<p>India is home to several important passes like Nathu La in Sikkim, Khardung La in Ladakh, and Bum La in Arunachal Pradesh. These passes serve strategic, military, and trade purposes, connecting India to neighboring regions like Tibet and China.</p>
