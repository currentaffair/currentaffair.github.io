<h2>What is NavIC?</h2>
<p>The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), or NavIC, is India's own satellite navigation system, designed to offer accurate positioning services within India and up to 1500 kilometers around its borders. It supports applications like navigation, disaster management, and vehicle tracking.</p>
<h2>Key Features of NavIC</h2>
<p>NavIC has seven satellites, with three in geostationary orbit and four in inclined geosynchronous orbit. It provides Standard Positioning Service (SPS) for civilians and Restricted Service (RS) for authorized users like defense personnel.</p>
<h2>NVS-02 Satellite</h2>
<p>The NVS-02 is the second satellite in India's second-generation navigation constellation. It is equipped with Indian-made atomic clocks and will improve the accuracy and efficiency of NavIC services, including navigation, precision agriculture, and fleet management.</p>
<h2>NVS-02 Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Weight: 2,250 kg</li>
<li>Power Capacity: 3 kW</li>
<li>Atomic Clock: Rubidium Atomic Frequency Standard (RAFS)</li>
<li>Lifespan: 12 years</li>
</ul>
<h2>GSLV Rocket</h2>
<p>The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) is used by ISRO to launch satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbit. It uses a cryogenic engine to provide high efficiency and reach the required orbit, allowing satellites to remain stationary over a fixed point on Earth.</p>
