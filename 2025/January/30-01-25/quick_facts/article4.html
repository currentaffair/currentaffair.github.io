<h2>About the Memorial</h2>
<p>The National War Memorial, located at India Gate in New Delhi, honors Indian military personnel who served in armed conflicts post-independence. Inaugurated on February 25, 2019, it commemorates wars with Pakistan, China, and other significant operations.</p>
<h2>Design and Features</h2>
<p>The memorial's design features concentric circles symbolizing ancient Indian battle formations. At the center, the Amar Jawan Jyoti (Eternal Flame) represents the immortality of fallen soldiers' spirits. The four circles—Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra, Rakshak Chakra, and Param Yodha Sthal—highlight bravery, sacrifice, protection, and honor for Param Vir Chakra winners.</p>
<h2>Key Aspects</h2>
<p>The gold-script memorial walls inscribe the names of fallen soldiers, and the memorial's special status is managed by the Ministry of Defense's Special Projects Division. Its purpose is to celebrate the valor and sacrifice of India's soldiers rather than evoke sadness.</p>
<h2>Amar Jawan Jyoti</h2>
<p>The Amar Jawan Jyoti's flame was established to honor soldiers who died in the 1971 war, marking the creation of Bangladesh. It serves as a reminder of the soldiers' sacrifice and remains an immortal symbol of their valor.</p>
