<h2>What is the Doctrine?</h2>
<p>The Doctrine of Merger states that when a higher court reviews a lower court's decision, the lower court's order merges with the higher court's final judgment. This means the higher courtâ€™s order is the final and binding ruling.</p>
<h2>Importance of the Doctrine</h2>
<p>This doctrine ensures clarity, prevents conflicting orders, and maintains the integrity and hierarchy of the judicial system.</p>
<h2>Applicability</h2>
<p>The doctrine is not always applicable. It depends on the jurisdiction of the superior court and the specific subject matter of the case. If the subject does not require a merger, the doctrine may not apply.</p>
<h2>Relation to Special Leave Petitions</h2>
<p>In India, under Article 136, the Supreme Court can grant special leave to appeal against subordinate court decisions. If the Supreme Court modifies or affirms the decision, the lower court's order merges. If the petition is dismissed, the lower court's order stands.</p>
