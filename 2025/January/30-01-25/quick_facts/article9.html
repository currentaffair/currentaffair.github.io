<h2>What is the Bow-String Arch Bridge?</h2>
<p>The bow-string arch bridge is part of the Mumbai Coastal Road Project (MCRP), designed to connect Mumbai's Coastal Road to the Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL). It aims to reduce traffic congestion and offer a direct north-south route along the western coastline.</p>
<h2>Bridge Design Features</h2>
<p>The bridge spans 827 meters, with 699 meters over the Arabian Sea. It features a 143-meter long, 27-meter wide, and 31-meter high 'Bo Arch String Girder' weighing 2,400 metric tons. Its use of high-tension chords minimizes the number of pillars and environmental impact.</p>
<h2>Mumbai Coastal Road Project</h2>
<p>The MCRP is a large-scale infrastructure project aimed at constructing a 29.2 km, 8-lane expressway along Mumbai's western coastline. It will connect Marine Drive in the south to Kandivali in the north and include India's first undersea tunnel, significantly reducing travel time.</p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>The MCRP aims to ease traffic congestion and create a sustainable, efficient, and livable urban environment for Mumbai's residents, transforming the city's infrastructure.</p>
