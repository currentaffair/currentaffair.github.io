<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A 24-year-old woman was sentenced to death by a Thiruvananthapuram court for poisoning her boyfriend in 2022 with paraquat, a toxic herbicide.</p>
<h2>About Paraquat</h2>
<p>Paraquat, also known as paraquat dichloride, is a highly toxic herbicide used to control weeds and desiccate crops like cotton. It is classified as a Category 2 chemical by the WHO, meaning it is moderately hazardous and irritating. Despite its toxicity, it is still in use in countries like the US and India.</p>
<h2>Poisoning and Symptoms</h2>
<p>Paraquat poisoning occurs through ingestion, skin contact, or inhalation. It causes damage to the mouth, stomach, intestines, and spreads to the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Symptoms include kidney failure, heart issues, respiratory failure, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Ingesting large amounts can lead to severe issues such as seizures and nausea.</p>
<h2>Treatments</h2>
<p>There is no known antidote for paraquat poisoning. Immediate treatment involves using activated charcoal or Fuller’s earth to bind the chemical, followed by hospital care.</p>
<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>Paraquat’s sale is banned in over 70 countries, including China and the European Union, due to its potent toxicity. In the US, it is restricted to licensed commercial users, and in India, its use is regulated by the Central Insecticides Board and Registration Committee (CIBRC) under the Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare.</p>
