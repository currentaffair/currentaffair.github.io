        Economic Growth under Manmohan Singh and Post-2015 Challenges
    </div>

    <div class="container">

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The period between 2004 and 2014 under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was marked by unprecedented economic growth and significant poverty reduction. However, post-2015, a series of policy challenges and economic shocks have reversed many of these gains. This article explores the contributions of Manmohan Singh's leadership, the decline in economic performance after 2015, and the challenges India faces in its quest for sustainable growth moving forward.</p>

        <h2>Contributions of Manmohan Singh's Leadership (2004-2014)</h2>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Macroeconomic Policies and Growth</h3>
            <p>Under Manmohan Singh, India's economy witnessed remarkable growth, driven by sound macroeconomic policies. Savings and investment rates surged during this period, with the savings rate rising to 23% of GDP by 2003-04. Investment-to-GDP ratios increased from 24% to 38% between 2004 and 2010, facilitating robust economic growth at an average rate of 8.5% per annum between 2004 and 2009.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Export Growth and Broad-Based Economic Expansion</h3>
            <p>Stable exchange rates and targeted policies led to export growth of 15-18% annually during this period. Additionally, growth was broad-based, encompassing both organized and unorganized sectors. Aggregate demand remained strong as growth engines such as private and public investment, consumption, exports, and government spending all contributed to the economy's upward trajectory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Job Creation and Rising Wages</h3>
            <p>Under Singh's leadership, India saw a historic shift in employment patterns. For the first time since independence, the absolute number of agricultural workers declined. Construction jobs doubled from 26 million in 2004 to 51 million in 2012. Meanwhile, manufacturing and modern service sectors also saw growth, resulting in increased job opportunities. Real wages rose consistently until 2015, benefiting both casual and regular workers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Poverty Reduction</h3>
            <p>One of the most significant achievements of this period was the reduction in poverty. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, over 138 million people were lifted above the poverty line, reflecting the positive impact of the growth policies implemented during Singh's tenure.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Post-2015 Decline: Economic Shocks and Challenges</h2>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Decline in GDP Growth</h3>
            <p>After 2015, India's GDP growth slowed significantly. From an average growth rate of 8.5% per annum in the previous decade, the average growth dropped to 5.8% between 2015 and 2024. Several factors contributed to this downturn, including the demonetization policy, poorly implemented Goods and Services Tax (GST), and the severe economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Unemployment Surge</h3>
            <p>Unemployment reached a 45-year high, with the unemployment rate climbing to 6.1% in 2017-18. The number of jobless individuals tripled from 1 crore in 2011-12 to 3 crore in 2017-18. Youth unemployment also saw a sharp rise, with graduate and postgraduate unemployment standing at 33% in 2022-23.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Reversal of Structural Change</h3>
            <p>The structural changes achieved during Singh's tenure, such as the decline in the agricultural workforce, were reversed after 2015. Over 8 crore workers returned to agriculture between 2020 and 2024. The manufacturing sector also stagnated, with its share of Gross Value Added (GVA) declining from 17% to 13%. Labour-intensive industries suffered from job losses during this period.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Decline in Exports</h3>
            <p>While merchandise exports grew fourfold between 2004 and 2014, the post-2014 export growth has been slower. Exports reached $454 billion by 2022, a modest increase of 1.5 times from 2014 levels. This decline reflects the broader economic challenges India faced after 2015.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Challenges to India's Future Growth</h2>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Rising Inequality</h3>
            <p>One of the key challenges facing India today is the rising inequality in income and wealth. This growing disparity has resulted in constrained aggregate demand, which hinders India's economic recovery and growth prospects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Risk to Demographic Dividend</h3>
            <p>India's demographic dividend, characterized by a young workforce, faces significant risks. Stagnant job growth and policy-induced economic shocks threaten to undermine this advantage, posing a long-term challenge to India’s future growth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Risk of Economic Stagnation</h3>
            <p>India faces the potential risk of economic stagnation due to the reversal of the progress made during Singh's tenure. To avoid this, there is a need for policy reforms that focus on reviving labour-intensive industries and creating sustainable jobs to achieve the goal of a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2040.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The period under Manmohan Singh's leadership from 2004 to 2014 was marked by significant economic growth, poverty reduction, and job creation. However, the period post-2015 has seen a reversal of many of these gains due to various policy shocks and challenges. Moving forward, it is crucial for India to focus on sustainable growth policies and structural reforms to revive the economic momentum and capitalize on its demographic potential.</p>
