            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Air pollution has emerged as one of the most severe environmental risks in India, significantly affecting public health, economic productivity, and environmental sustainability. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) levels exceed the prescribed safety limits in most major cities, posing year-round challenges, particularly during the winter months.</p>
            <p>This article delves into the major sources of air pollution in India, evaluates its impacts on various sectors, and explores potential solutions inspired by both national and international efforts.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Key Sources of Air Pollution in India</h2>

            <h3>Transport Sector</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Dominance of Fossil Fuels:</strong> The increasing number of vehicles, combined with inadequate vehicular standards, results in high emissions of PM2.5. This contributes heavily to air pollution in urban areas.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Traffic Congestion:</strong> Even cities with metro systems suffer from high traffic congestion, worsening pollution due to inadequate last-mile connectivity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlighted">
                <p><strong>Policy Challenges:</strong> Despite policies like the 10-year vehicle age limit in Delhi, the implementation remains inconsistent. The slow adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is hindered by insufficient infrastructure and incentives.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Industrial Sector</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Usage of Polluting Fuels:</strong> Medium and small-scale industries largely depend on biomass, coal, and unregulated fuels, contributing significantly to air pollution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Poor Operational Practices:</strong> Inefficient operational practices and a lack of emissions monitoring in industries prevent the effective functioning of pollution control devices.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Municipal Waste Management</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Open Burning of Waste:</strong> The inefficiency in waste segregation leads to increased landfill fires and the burning of municipal waste, releasing harmful particulates into the atmosphere.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Re-Suspended Dust</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Urban Infrastructure Gaps:</strong> Dust from unpaved roads, construction sites, and barren lands significantly contributes to the levels of PM10 in the air.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Agriculture</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Stubble Burning:</strong> In states like Punjab and Haryana, the practice of stubble burning exacerbates pollution, particularly in Delhi-NCR during the winter months.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Unsustainable Practices:</strong> The excessive use of chemical fertilizers results in ammonia emissions, further degrading air quality in agricultural regions.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Rural Emissions</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Biomass Burning:</strong> In rural areas, households rely on biomass for cooking and heating, emitting large quantities of particulate matter.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Regional Contribution:</strong> Emissions from rural areas significantly impact urban air quality due to the interconnected nature of airsheds.</p>

            <h2>Impacts of Air Pollution</h2>

            <h3>Public Health</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p>Air pollution contributes to a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. Marginalized communities, especially in urban slums, face disproportionately high health risks due to poor air quality.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Economic Consequences</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p>The economic burden of air pollution is significant, with increased healthcare costs and productivity losses due to pollution-related illnesses. Workers' absenteeism from health problems exacerbates the economic downturn.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Environmental Degradation</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p>Air pollution adversely affects biodiversity, particularly in agricultural regions, where soil quality is degraded by pollutants. This also impacts food security in vulnerable regions.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Lessons from China</h2>

            <h3>Beijing’s Phased Approach</h3>
            <p>Beijing offers valuable lessons in addressing air pollution through its phased approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1970–1990:</strong> Focused on controlling emissions from coal-fired power plants.</li>
                <li><strong>1990–2000:</strong> Tackled industrial and vehicular emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>2000 Onwards:</strong> Implemented a regional pollution strategy addressing complex sources across multiple sectors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Comprehensive Measures</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p>China’s measures included promoting clean energy, improving fuel quality, incentivizing the scrappage of old vehicles, and enhancing public transportation systems.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Great Green Wall</h3>
            <div class="highlighted">
                <p>China’s successful implementation of the Great Green Wall project helped reduce dust storms and particulate matter through large-scale afforestation across northern China.</p>
