<h1>Decline of Private Members' Bills in Indian Parliament</h1>
<p>Private Members' Bills, introduced by MPs not in the government, are vital for independent expression in India's Parliament. However, due to limited time allocation, these bills have seen a significant decline in recent years, with the 17th Lok Sabha allocating only 9.08 hours to them.</p>
<h2>Private Members' Bills: A Crucial Role</h2>
<p>Private Members' Bills allow MPs to propose laws on important issues, providing a platform for independent legislative proposals. The process involves drafting, submitting, and debating bills, but the time allotted is minimal. Historically, only 14 bills have passed since India's independence, with none passing since 1970.</p>
<h2>Reasons for the Decline</h2>
<p>The decline can be attributed to limited discussion time, particularly on Fridays when many MPs leave for their constituencies. Additionally, a lack of serious engagement from MPs has further diminished the impact of these bills. In the 17th Lok Sabha, just 9.08 hours were spent on such bills.</p>
<h2>Suggestions for Revival</h2>
<p>Shifting Private Members' Bills to midweek sessions could provide more time for discussion and increase MP participation, ensuring the protection of individual parliamentary expression.</p>
