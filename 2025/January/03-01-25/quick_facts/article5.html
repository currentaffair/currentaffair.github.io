<h1>CISF Reduces Suicide Rate by 40%</h1>
<p>The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has successfully reduced its suicide rate by 40% in 2024, bringing it below the national average for the first time in five years.</p>
<h2>Reduction in Suicide Rates</h2>
<p>The CISF suicide rate dropped to 9.87 per lakh people in 2024, compared to the national rate of 12.4 per lakh in 2022, marking a significant 40% reduction from the previous year.</p>
<h2>Factors Contributing to Stress</h2>
<p>CISF personnel face challenges like prolonged family separation, high-pressure work environments, and personal issues. The unique occupational challenges of CAPFs contribute to their vulnerability to stress.</p>
<h2>Proactive Measures Taken by CISF</h2>
<p>CISF implemented several mental health initiatives, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced communication with regular visits and daily briefings.</li>
<li>Online grievance portal for real-time monitoring and resolution.</li>
<li>24×7 tele-counselling and in-person counselling services, with over 4,200 personnel availing counselling by September 2024.</li>
<li>Collaboration with AIIMS for a mental health study and actionable recommendations at the unit level.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact and Significance</h2>
<p>The CISF’s proactive efforts show the effectiveness of mental health interventions. These measures may serve as a model for other CAPFs and organizations dealing with high-stress environments.</p>
