<h1>NPCI Extends Market Cap Deadline for UPI Apps</h1>
<p>The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has extended the deadline for Third-Party App Providers (TPAPs) to comply with the 30% transaction cap on UPI transactions until December 31, 2026. This impacts major TPAPs like PhonePe and Google Pay, which hold over 80% of UPI transactions.</p>
<h2>Key Details:</h2>
<p>The NPCI introduced a cap in November 2020 to ensure a balanced ecosystem. TPAPs exceeding the 30% cap must halt onboarding new customers until they comply. The cap is based on average transaction volumes over three months, with phased compliance deadlines for existing TPAPs.</p>
<h2>Background on NPCI and TPAPs:</h2>
<p>NPCI was established under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, by the RBI and Indian Banks' Association. TPAPs are entities offering UPI-based services through mobile apps, acting as intermediaries between users and banks, but are not part of financial institutions.</p>
