<h1>GEAC Rules Amendments on Conflict of Interest</h1>
<p>The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has amended rules for selecting expert members to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) to address concerns of conflict of interest.</p>
<h2>Amendments to GEAC Rules</h2>
<p>Expert members are required to disclose any direct or indirect interests that could cause conflicts with their duties. They must recuse themselves from discussions when necessary and provide a detailed affiliation form covering the past 10 years.</p>
<h2>Supreme Court’s Role</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court's split verdict on GM mustard in July 2023 highlighted the need for addressing conflict of interest in decision-making bodies. The final resolution of GM mustard’s approval is still pending.</p>
<h2>Background of Conflict Allegations</h2>
<p>In 2013, allegations arose regarding a member of a Technical Expert Committee having ties to Monsanto, which raised questions about the impartiality of GM crop recommendations.</p>
<h2>Significance of the Amendments</h2>
<p>The amendments aim to enhance transparency and accountability in GEAC decisions, addressing public concerns about bias in approving GM crops and following the SC's directive on conflict of interest issues.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>The Centre is expected to formulate a national policy on GM crops as per the SC's 2023 order. The final decision on GM mustard’s release is still under judicial review.</p>
