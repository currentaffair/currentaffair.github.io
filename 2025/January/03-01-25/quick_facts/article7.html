<h1>Human Trafficking in West Bengal</h1>
<p>Human trafficking remains a significant challenge in West Bengal, exacerbated by climate change and socio-environmental vulnerabilities in regions like the Sundarbans.</p>
<h2>Climate Change and Trafficking Connection</h2>
<p>Repeated cyclones, such as Amphan (2020) and Yaas (2021), have intensified poverty and displacement, leaving vulnerable populations, especially women and children, at risk of trafficking.</p>
<h2>Data and Trends</h2>
<p>In 2022, there were 58,871 missing persons in West Bengal, including 53,655 women and 12,455 children. Human trafficking cases have steadily increased, with 59 cases in 2020, 61 in 2021, and 67 in 2022. The victims in 2022 included 78 individuals, predominantly girls.</p>
<h2>Exploitation by Traffickers</h2>
<p>Traffickers exploit the socio-economic vulnerabilities of impoverished individuals, luring them with false job promises.</p>
<h2>Conviction Rates</h2>
<p>The conviction rate for trafficking cases in 2022 was 55%, indicating significant gaps in addressing this issue effectively.</p>
<h2>Call for Integrated Interventions</h2>
<p>NGOs like ILFAT and Bijoyini are working to rescue survivors, raise awareness, and advocate for systemic changes. They highlight the intersection of climate change, poverty, and trafficking, urging integrated solutions.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>Key recommendations include creating livelihood opportunities and improving support systems in disaster-affected areas.</p>
