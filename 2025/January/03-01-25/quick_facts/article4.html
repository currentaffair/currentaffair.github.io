<h1>SC Petition on Senior Advocate Designation</h1>
<p>Advocate Mathews J. Nedumpara has petitioned the Supreme Court to abolish the senior advocate designation system, alleging that it fosters elitism and privilege in the legal profession.</p>
<h2>Senior Advocate Designation</h2>
<p>The senior advocate designation is governed by Section 16 of the Advocates Act, with senior advocates enjoying privileges such as pre-audience rights under Section 23(5). They are distinguished based on professional standing, expertise, and contributions to law.</p>
<h2>Petitioner's Allegations</h2>
<p>The petitioner claims the designation system is biased in favor of judges' relatives and influential personalities, violating constitutional rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21. He demands the abolition of both the senior advocate designation and the Collegium system.</p>
<h2>Court's Response</h2>
<p>Justice B.R. Gavai challenged the petitioner to provide evidence of favoritism, terming some claims as “scurrilous and unfounded.” The court has granted the petitioner time to revise or withdraw the petition, warning of action against baseless allegations.</p>
<h2>Arguments by Mr. Nedumpara</h2>
<p>Nedumpara criticized the creation of a “special class” of advocates with privileges, citing the recent designation of 70 lawyers by the Delhi High Court as an example of bias.</p>
<h2>Possible Outcomes</h2>
<p>If the petition is not revised, the court may dismiss it or take action against the petitioners. The case may also reignite debates on reforms in the legal profession.</p>
