<h1>Advanced Injectable Hydrogel for Cancer Treatment</h1>
<p>Researchers from IIT-Guwahati and Bose Institute, Kolkata have developed an injectable hydrogel designed to improve localized cancer treatments.</p>
<h2>Development of Injectable Hydrogel</h2>
<p>The hydrogel functions as a stable reservoir for anti-cancer drugs, ensuring controlled release and targeting tumors without harming healthy cells. It is specifically aimed at breast cancer therapy.</p>
<h2>Scientific Basis</h2>
<p>The hydrogel is composed of ultra-short peptides that remain insoluble in biological fluids, ensuring its localization at the injection site. It also reacts to elevated glutathione (GSH) levels, which are abundant in tumor cells, triggering precise drug activation. The hydrogel mimics living tissue structure, making it ideal for biomedical applications.</p>
<h2>Advantages Over Conventional Treatments</h2>
<p>Traditional chemotherapy causes systemic side effects, affecting both healthy and cancerous cells. In contrast, the hydrogel targets the tumor site directly, reducing systemic side effects and improving treatment efficacy.</p>
<h2>Research Collaboration</h2>
<p>The research was led by Debapratim Das (IIT-G) with co-authors Tanushree Das and Ritvika Kushwaha. Contributors from Bose Institute include Kuldip Jana, Satyajit Halder, and Anup Kumar Misra. The findings were published in the journal <i>Materials Horizons</i>.</p>
<h2>Potential Impact</h2>
<p>This research offers a revolutionary approach to breast cancer therapy and other localized cancer treatments, enhancing precision and aligning with the need for minimally invasive solutions.</p>
