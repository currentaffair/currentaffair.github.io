<h1>Advocates of Supreme Court</h1>
<p>The Supreme Court of India recently saw the appointment of 116 new Senior Advocates in 2024, raising concerns about their quality. Senior Advocates, designated based on legal experience, special knowledge, and contributions, play a crucial role in handling high-profile cases like death penalties and bail applications.</p>
<h2>Senior Advocates: Role and Restrictions</h2>
<p>Senior Advocates are appointed after at least 10 years of experience and must meet specific criteria. They argue legal cases but cannot directly take instructions from clients, and have restrictions on drafting pleadings and advising on evidence.</p>
<h2>2017 Reforms</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court implemented reforms in 2017 to make the process of designating Senior Advocates more transparent and inclusive, driven by a public interest litigation. These reforms include a focus on judgments, academic contributions, and overall experience.</p>
<h2>Advocates-on-Record</h2>
<p>Advocates-on-Record are the only lawyers authorized to file documents and represent parties in the Supreme Court. In contrast, other advocates can argue cases but cannot file documents.</p>
