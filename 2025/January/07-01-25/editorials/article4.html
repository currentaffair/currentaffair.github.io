    Global Nutrition Targets
</header>
<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The recent Lancet study evaluating the global progress on the Global Nutrition Targets (GNTs) from 2012 to 2021 highlights alarming concerns regarding the slow progress made in tackling maternal and child malnutrition. The report calls for re-evaluating current strategies and developing more innovative approaches to address these persistent issues.</p>
<h3>What are Global Nutrition Targets (GNTs)?</h3>
<p>In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed a comprehensive implementation plan to tackle maternal, infant, and young child nutrition. This plan set six ambitious global nutrition targets aimed for 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieve a 40% reduction in the number of children under-5 who are stunted.</li>
<li>Achieve a 50% reduction in anaemia in women of reproductive age.</li>
<li>Achieve a 30% reduction in low birth weight.</li>
<li>Ensure that there is no increase in childhood overweight.</li>
<li>Increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months to at least 50%.</li>
<li>Reduce and maintain childhood wasting to less than 5%.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Terms</h3>
<p><strong>Malnutrition:</strong> An imbalance between the nutrients the body needs and those it receives, leading to undernutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight) and overnutrition (overweight, obesity).</p>
<p><strong>Anaemia:</strong> A condition of low red blood cells or haemoglobin, which primarily affects women and children, reducing oxygen supply to tissues.</p>

<h2>Key Findings of the Study</h2>
<p>The study highlighted several alarming findings regarding the slow and insufficient progress in meeting the GNTs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Across 204 countries, few countries are expected to meet the targets for stunting in children under-5 by 2025.</li>
<li>None of the countries are projected to meet targets for low birth weight, anaemia, and childhood overweight by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anaemia and India</h3>
<p>Anaemia in India has remained static for two decades, with iron deficiency being the primary cause. However, iron deficiency accounts for only one-third of anaemia cases. The ongoing prevalence of anaemia was further exacerbated during the Covid-19 lockdown due to the suspension of school meals under the Midday Meal Scheme.</p>
<p>The study also found discrepancies in anaemia measurements in India, with venous blood-based prevalence being significantly lower than capillary blood-based measurements in national surveys.</p>
<h3>Stunting in Children</h3>
<p>Stunting in India often develops during the first two years of life, with the percentage increasing from 7–8% at birth to 40% by the age of two. Overfeeding children after age two may contribute to being overweight, rather than addressing stunting.</p>
<p>Poor children in India consume only 7 grams of fat per day, while the required intake is 30–40 grams, exacerbating the problem.</p>
<h3>Childhood Overweight</h3>
<p>Childhood overweight is on the rise globally, including in India. In India, 50% of children are affected by "metabolic overnutrition," which may lead to chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension in later life.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Diversify diets to address anaemia, focus on preventing stunting in the first two years, and improve energy intake, especially fat intake, for children under 3.</p>
</div>
<h3>Challenges for Achieving GNTs</h3>
<p>Despite various efforts, several challenges hinder the achievement of the GNTs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persistent Anaemia:</strong> Anaemia prevalence remains high, especially among women of reproductive age in low-income countries.</li>
<li><strong>Slow Progress on Stunting:</strong> The number of stunted children is projected to be 127 million by 2025, far above the target of 100 million.</li>
<li><strong>Rising Overweight and Obesity:</strong> Increasing rates of overweight and obesity affect millions of children, driven by changing dietary habits and urbanization.</li>
<li><strong>Childhood Wasting:</strong> Around 45 million children under five are affected by wasting globally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>India’s Initiatives Related to Nutrition</h2>
<p>India has taken several steps to address nutritional challenges, including the following initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mission Poshan 2.0</li>
<li>Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme</li>
<li>Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)</li>
<li>Mid-Day Meal Scheme</li>
<li>Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG)</li>
<li>Mother’s Absolute Affection (MAA)</li>
<li>Poshan Vatikas</li>
</ul>
<h3>Way Forward</h3>
<p>To achieve the targets, several policy realignments and actions are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote region-specific dietary solutions through national programs like POSHAN Abhiyaan.</li>
<li>Address gaps in the Public Distribution System (PDS) to include nutrition-dense food items.</li>
<li>Strengthen resource allocation and integrate nutrition outcomes into various sectors such as health, food systems, and water sanitation.</li>
<li>Enhance monitoring mechanisms to track progress on nutrition indicators.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The global progress towards achieving the Global Nutrition Targets has been slow, and substantial challenges remain. While the initiatives undertaken by India are commendable, there is a need for more innovative, region-specific strategies and timely action to address malnutrition in all its forms, including both undernutrition and overnutrition.</p>
