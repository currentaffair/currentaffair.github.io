<h1>NHRC Concern Over Sanitation Worker Deaths</h1>
<p>The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) expressed grave concern over the deaths of sanitation workers in India, highlighting 377 fatalities between 2019 and 2023 due to hazardous tasks like cleaning sewers and septic tanks. Despite existing laws against manual scavenging, these deaths remain an issue.</p>
<h2>NHRC Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pilot Project:</strong> A pilot project using technology such as robots for cleaning sewers and septic tanks to reduce worker deaths.</li>
<li><strong>Legislative and Executive Measures:</strong> More focus on the root causes of worker deaths and potential remedial actions.</li>
<li><strong>Rehabilitation and Welfare:</strong> Effective surveys to implement rehabilitation programs and ensure sanitation workers receive minimum wages.</li>
<li><strong>Awareness Campaigns:</strong> Increase awareness through initiatives like Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and NAMASTE to reduce manual scavenging.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact and Conclusion</h2>
<p>The NHRC's intervention emphasizes the need for technological solutions and better enforcement of laws to prevent sanitation worker deaths and resolve the ongoing issue of manual scavenging in India.</p>
