<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On 16th January 2025, social activist Anna Hazare, Justice (retd) N. Santosh Hegde, and Attorney-General R. Venkataramani will be felicitated on the occasion of Lokpal Foundation Day. The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, which empowers the anti-corruption body to investigate allegations of corruption, came into effect on 16th January 2014.</p>
<p>The first Lokpal Day will be celebrated on 16th January 2025 in Delhi Cantt, with the Chief Justice of India (CJI) as the Chief Guest.</p>
<h3>What is Lokpal?</h3>
<p>The Lokpal is an independent statutory body established under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, to combat corruption in public offices and ensure accountability among public functionaries. They perform the function of an "ombudsman” and inquire into allegations of corruption against certain public functionaries and for related matters.</p>
<p>The Act also provided for the establishment of Lokayukta for States.</p>
<h3>Origin of Lokpal</h3>
<p>The concept of the Lokpal/Lokayukta originates from the Ombudsman system in Scandinavian countries. In India, the Administrative Reforms Commission (1966-70) recommended the establishment of the Lokpal at the central level and Lokayuktas in the states. Prior to the enactment of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, several states had already created the Lokayukta institution through state laws. Maharashtra was the first state to establish a Lokayukta body in 1971.</p>
<h3>Salary and Allowances</h3>
<p>The Chairperson's salary and allowances are equivalent to those of the Chief Justice of India, while the Members receive benefits similar to those of a Judge of the Supreme Court of India.</p>
<h3>Proceeding of Lokpal</h3>
<p>On receiving a complaint, the Lokpal may initiate a preliminary inquiry through its Inquiry Wing or refer cases to agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). The CVC reports back to Lokpal for Groups A and B officials, while it takes independent action for Groups C and D under the CVC Act, 2003.</p>
<h3>Lokayukta</h3>
<p>The Lokayukta is a state-level anti-corruption authority in India, established to investigate grievances and allegations against public servants.</p>
<h3>Significance of the Lokpal Institution</h3>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Combating Corruption:</strong> The Lokpal and Lokayuktas aim to address systemic corruption by providing a dedicated platform for investigating complaints against public officials, deterring corrupt practices, and promoting ethical governance.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing Accountability:</strong> These institutions enhance accountability by holding public officials responsible for their actions, helping restore public trust in government.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Citizens:</strong> The Act empowers citizens to file complaints against corruption, offering protection from retaliation by powerful officials.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Good Governance:</strong> Independent oversight by Lokpal and Lokayukts ensures the effective use of public resources and encourages officials to act in the public's best interest.</p>
</div>
<h3>Global Similar Practices</h3>
<p>Countries like Hong Kong, Singapore, South Africa, and Brazil have similar anti-corruption bodies, which focus on investigating and prosecuting corruption in the public and private sectors. These global models provide valuable lessons for India’s Lokpal system.</p>
<h3>Limitations of Lokpal</h3>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Limitation Period for Filing Complaints:</strong> Complaints against public servants must be filed within 7 years from the date of the alleged corruption or when the complainant becomes aware of it. This may exclude older cases.</p>
<p><strong>Severe Punishment for False Complaints:</strong> The heavy penalties for false complaints may discourage individuals from lodging complaints, even when justified.</p>
<p><strong>Independence Issues:</strong> There are concerns over political influence affecting the impartiality of Lokpal and Lokayukts.</p>
<p><strong>Ineffectiveness in Tackling Corruption:</strong> The Lokpal has struggled to effectively address corruption. As of 2023, it has not initiated prosecution against any individual for corruption despite receiving 8,703 complaints.</p>
</div>
<h3>Way Forward</h3>
<ul>
<li>Review and extend the limitation period for filing complaints.</li>
<li>Implement balanced penalties for false complaints.</li>
<li>Strengthen safeguards to ensure independence from political influence.</li>
<li>Enhance coordination mechanisms between Lokpal and other agencies like CBI, ED, and CVC.</li>
<li>Adopt global best practices for greater whistleblower protection and effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<div class="conclusion">
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Lokpal and Lokayukts play a crucial role in the fight against corruption in India, but challenges remain in their independence and effectiveness. A comprehensive review and improvement of the existing system, based on global practices and local needs, could enhance their impact and restore public trust in governance.</p>
