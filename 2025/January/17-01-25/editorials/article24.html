<h2>Introduction: US NSA Jake Sullivan’s Visit to India</h2>
<p>Jake Sullivan’s visit to India marks the culmination of his tenure as the US National Security Advisor under President Joe Biden. The visit emphasizes the US commitment to strengthening its strategic partnership with India, focusing particularly on advancing technology cooperation and ensuring continuity in bilateral relations as political transitions occur.</p>
<h3>India-US Advanced Technology Collaboration: Key Features</h3>
<p>This section explores the deepening collaboration between the US and India in the field of advanced technology. It highlights the initiatives and policy tools designed to cement the partnership.</p>
<h3>Commitment to Deepening Ties</h3>
<p>The Biden administration has worked to elevate the India-US partnership, focusing on mitigating unanticipated crises that could derail their strategic relationship. This strong commitment has manifested in various areas, including defense, space, and technology.</p>
<h3>Focus on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET)</h3>
<p>Launched in January 2023, the iCET initiative, spearheaded by Jake Sullivan and Indian NSA Ajit Doval, marks a turning point in the India-US collaboration. It targets AI, semiconductors, space, and biotechnology as key sectors for the future global economy.</p>

<h3>Significance of iCET</h3>
<p>iCET facilitates collaboration beyond government-level engagements, offering opportunities for the private sector, startups, and research communities to contribute. The initiative aims to mitigate the global economic risks associated with China's dominance, creating a more balanced geopolitical framework in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
</div>
<h3>Policy Instruments</h3>
<p>One of the core aspects of the US-India relationship is the integration of industries, startups, and research institutions. The announcement by Jake Sullivan to lift restrictions on civilian space cooperation, along with efforts to remove key atomic energy centres from the US blacklist, reflects a growing desire to resolve outstanding issues.</p>
<h3>History of India-US Technology Cooperation</h3>
<p>The history of technology cooperation between India and the US dates back to the early decades of India’s independence. The US has played a crucial role in the development of India’s nuclear, space, and agricultural sectors, contributing significantly to India’s scientific and technological education.</p>
<h3>Early Decades of Collaboration</h3>
<p>From the 1950s onward, the US was a key partner in India’s nuclear and space programs, providing technical and educational support. This laid the foundation for further collaboration in these fields, which would take on greater significance in the coming decades.</p>
<h3>Challenges in the 1970s and Beyond</h3>
<p>However, in the 1970s, the relationship was interrupted due to the imposition of non-proliferation laws and sanctions, which led to a freeze in technological exchanges. India was subjected to international non-proliferation controls, impacting its access to critical technologies.</p>
<h3>Revival in 1990s and 2000s</h3>
<p>In the 1990s and 2000s, India and the US sought common ground despite these challenges. A significant breakthrough came during the Bush-Manmohan era (2005-08) with the India-US civil nuclear deal, which laid the groundwork for further cooperation.</p>
<h3>Lingering Issues</h3>
<p>While the civil nuclear deal was a major achievement, certain issues remain unresolved. Notably, no international suppliers, aside from Russia, have invested in building nuclear power plants in India. The Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010, remains a major barrier for US companies looking to invest in India's nuclear sector.</p>
<h3>Geoeconomic and Geopolitical Implications</h3>
<p>The geopolitical and geoeconomic implications of the India-US technological partnership are significant. Both countries share common goals of maintaining US technological leadership and reducing dependence on China. This dynamic will continue to drive collaboration in the coming years.</p>
<h3>Biden’s Legacy</h3>
<p>Biden has laid a strong foundation for long-term technological collaboration with India. By addressing strategic needs, both countries have aimed to foster an alliance that transcends political leadership transitions.</p>
<h3>Continuity under Trump</h3>
<p>Though Biden has left an indelible mark on the India-US relationship, the continuation of these efforts under the Trump administration is crucial. Trump's policies towards India emphasize reclaiming US technological leadership, especially amid the ongoing competition with China.</p>
<h3>Challenges and Way Forward</h3>
<p>To sustain this cooperation, continued diplomatic efforts are necessary. As India adapts to changing US political landscapes, it must navigate potential shifts under future administrations, such as Trump’s approach to international collaboration.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Jake Sullivan’s visit is a pivotal moment in India-US relations, reaffirming the commitment to technological collaboration. However, the future of this partnership may face challenges depending on the political transitions in both countries, especially with the potential shifts under Trump’s administration.</p>
