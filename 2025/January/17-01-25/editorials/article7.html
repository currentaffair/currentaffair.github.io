<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Indian economy has witnessed a significant slowdown, with growth expected to decelerate to 6.4% in the fiscal year 2024-25, down from 8.2% in 2023-24. The second quarter of 2024-25 saw a sharp decline to 5.4%, yet the positive outlook suggests that growth could pick up in the second half of the year.</p>
<h2>Reasons for Moderation in Growth</h2>
<h3>Government Capital Expenditure (Capex)</h3>
<p>Government capital expenditure, which has been a key growth driver post-Covid, has shown signs of deceleration. This is attributed to the election cycles in both state and central governments, which slowed down investment activity. In the first eight months of the fiscal year, the Centre's capital expenditure fell by 12%, and state-level capital expenditure also declined by 6%. Additionally, major CPSEs reported a 10.8% drop in capital expenditure.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation, which reflects investment growth, is expected to slow from 9% in 2023-24 to 6.4% in 2024-25. Despite elections being over, it is unlikely that government expenditure will pick up substantially, raising concerns about future investment growth.</p>
<h3>Private Consumption</h3>
<p>Private consumption is expected to grow at a strong pace of 7.3% in 2024-25, a significant increase from the 4% growth seen in the previous year. Consumption contributes to around 55% of India's GDP, so this recovery is vital for overall growth. Rural consumption has been buoyed by healthy agricultural production, while urban consumption shows signs of moderation. However, high food inflation (around 7.6%) remains a concern, though it is expected to ease in the coming months, supporting further consumption growth.</p>
<h3>External Sector</h3>
<p>India's goods and services exports are expected to grow by 6% in 2024-25, up from 2.6% in the previous year. While services exports are strong, merchandise exports are starting to show signs of recovery. However, the global trade outlook is uncertain due to changes in trade policy with the new US President, leading to volatility in financial markets and a strengthening US dollar.</p>
<h2>Sector-Wise Analysis</h2>
<h3>Agriculture</h3>
<p>Agriculture remains a strong contributor to India's economic growth, with favorable monsoon conditions supporting agricultural output.</p>
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>The services sector is expected to grow at a healthy rate of 7.2%, though it represents a slight slowdown from the previous year's 7.6% growth.</p>
<h3>Industrial Sector</h3>
<p>Industrial growth is expected to decelerate sharply, from 9.5% in the previous year to 6.2% this year. Mining and manufacturing sectors are facing sharp slowdowns, while the construction sector continues to show robust growth.</p>
<h2>Fiscal Position and Challenges</h2>
<h3>Nominal GDP Growth</h3>
<p>Nominal GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 9.7%, falling short of the Union Budget’s target of 10.5%. Additionally, the Centre is likely to miss its capex target by around ₹1.5 trillion.</p>
<h3>Fiscal Deficit</h3>
<p>The fiscal deficit target for 2025-26 is set at 4.5% of GDP. However, some experts recommend slower fiscal consolidation to focus on growth-boosting measures, with a revised trajectory suggesting a fiscal deficit of 4.7% by 2025-26 and 4.5% achieved by 2027-28.</p>
<h2>Recommendations for the Union Budget</h2>
<h3>Capex-Led Recovery</h3>
<p>The government should continue focusing on capital expenditure while supplementing it with measures aimed at boosting consumption. A sustained rise in domestic consumption is crucial, especially given the slow recovery of private investment and uncertain external demand.</p>
<h3>Consumption-Boosting Measures</h3>
<p>Personal income tax cuts should be implemented to boost consumer sentiment and spending. Furthermore, focusing on job creation and skill development will help increase household incomes and sustain consumption growth.</p>
<h3>Fiscal Strategy</h3>
<p>Fiscal consolidation should be delayed to prioritize growth, even if the fiscal deficit exceeds 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26. Ensuring that government debt remains on a downward trajectory, despite slower fiscal consolidation, is critical for long-term economic stability.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>India’s economic growth has moderated due to weak government capex, slow private investment recovery, and global uncertainties. To regain a higher growth trajectory, the upcoming Union budget must focus on a balanced approach between capex, consumption-boosting measures, and job creation.</p>
