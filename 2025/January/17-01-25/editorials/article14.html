<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
            In 2024, India and several other countries experienced their hottest year on record. This alarming trend highlights the urgent need for India to not only reduce its greenhouse gas emissions but also adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change. These impacts pose significant threats to public health and the economy, given India's diverse and sensitive climate.
        </p>
<h2>Climate Risks and Resilience in India: Key Highlights</h2>
<h3>1. Widespread Climate Risks</h3>
<p>
            Nearly 80% of Indians live in districts at risk of floods, droughts, or cyclones. Hotspots exist where multiple disasters overlap, such as parts of Odisha, Telangana, and Gujarat. Climate extremes are felt year-round across the country, exacerbating the vulnerability of already marginalized populations.
        </p>
<h3>2. Heatwave Challenges</h3>
<p>
            In 2024, India experienced record-breaking heatwaves, with temperatures reaching nearly 50°C in Delhi. 23 states are heatwave-prone, and over 44,000 heatstroke cases and 300 fatalities were reported. The rising heat has significant impacts on public health, productivity, energy demand, and water reservoirs. For example, Delhi’s power demand during the June 2024 heatwave peaked at 8,647 MW, marking a 16% increase from the previous year.
        </p>
<h3>3. Monsoon Variability</h3>
<p>
            Uneven monsoons are causing significant consequences for agriculture. The Indo-Gangetic plains, for example, saw a 20% decline in southwest monsoon rainfall from 2012–2022. As a result, annual crop losses from extreme weather account for approximately 0.25% of India’s GDP, impacting both food security and economic stability.
        </p>
<h3>4. Cyclones and Floods</h3>
<p>
            Over the past two decades, the Arabian Sea has seen a 52% increase in tropical cyclones. Despite having a cyclone early warning system that covers 100% of at-risk populations, flood warnings reach only one-third of vulnerable areas. Severe flooding in 2024 affected several states, including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh. The government is working on improving urban flood preparedness under the “Mission Mausam” initiative.
        </p>
<h2>Adaptation and Resilience Strategies</h2>
<h3>1. Heat Stress Management</h3>
<p>
            To manage heat stress, detailed risk assessments at granular levels must be conducted. Vulnerable populations, such as those in urban slums, need prioritized action plans, while renewable energy-based solutions like solar chillers should be implemented to support sectors like dairy, which are directly affected by heat.
        </p>
<h3>2. Agricultural Adaptation</h3>
<p>
            One key strategy for agricultural adaptation is revamping crop-weather calendars, especially for rainfed crops, to account for changing monsoon patterns. India’s agricultural research organizations, like ICAR, have developed over 2,500 varieties of crops that are more resistant to floods and droughts. Local cropping practices must be contextualized to water availability and moisture changes to enhance resilience.
        </p>
<h3>3. Enhancing Disaster Risk Financing</h3>
<p>
            Strengthening city-level resilience through Urban Disaster Management Authorities is crucial. The Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 aims to facilitate this, while financial mechanisms such as city resilience bonds and green municipal bonds can mobilize resources to support climate adaptation efforts.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
                With the 2025 Budget approaching, it is crucial that climate resilience moves from the margins to the mainstream of our financial planning and priorities. Addressing climate change is not just an environmental concern; it is also an economic one. Investments in climate resilience, from agriculture to urban infrastructure, will yield long-term benefits, ensuring a sustainable future for India.
