<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Recent studies on Deccan volcanism reveal how this volcanic activity significantly shaped the biodiversity of the Indian subcontinent. While causing mass extinctions of fauna, it provided new opportunities for tropical flora to flourish, creating fertile and undisturbed habitats. This phenomenon occurred during the movement of the Indian plate across the equator and highlights the intricate relationship between volcanic activity and the Earth's biological history.</p>
<h3>Why is Deccan Volcanism in the News?</h3>
<p>A study recently uncovered that tropical flora exhibited remarkable resilience during the Deccan volcanism, a period that otherwise saw mass extinctions of numerous fauna species, including dinosaurs. The results underscore the resilience of tropical ecosystems, revealing how some flora thrived in the face of global climatic changes.</p>
<h3>Key Findings of the Study</h3>
<p>The study identifies two significant impacts of the Deccan volcanism:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact on Fauna and Flora:</strong> The volcanic activity led to the extinction of various fauna, including dinosaurs, but simultaneously facilitated the survival and growth of tropical flora. The warmer and more humid climate created ideal conditions for angiosperms to thrive.</li>
<li><strong>Global and Regional Implications:</strong> Deccan volcanism is thought to have played a role in the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction. However, tropical rainforests in the Indian Plate region adapted and flourished, showcasing the higher resilience of tropical flora.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Types of Flora and Their Importance</h3>
<p>Tropical flora, which includes species such as mahogany trees and orchids, thrive in regions with high temperatures and humidity near the equator. In contrast, gymnosperms, such as coniferous trees, produce exposed seeds, while angiosperms, like flowering plants, protect their seeds within fruits.</p>
<h3>Deccan Volcanism Theory</h3>
<p>The Deccan Volcanism Theory proposes that the volcanic eruptions that formed the Deccan Traps were a major contributor to the mass extinction event 66 million years ago. These eruptions were triggered by the movement of the Indian Plate over the Réunion hotspot, leading to the creation of vast volcanic plateaus and the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Economic Significance of Deccan Volcanism</h3>
<p>The Deccan Traps are rich in basaltic lava, with notable mineral resources such as iron ore, bauxite, and fertile black soil, which supports agriculture in regions like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.</p>
<h3>Movement of the Indian Plate</h3>
<p>The movement of the Indian Plate has been crucial in shaping the subcontinent's geological history. Starting as a part of Gondwanaland, it eventually drifted northward, leading to the collision with the Asian plate and the formation of the Himalayas. This collision also influenced the monsoon system of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<h3>Geological Impact</h3>
<p>The collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates, resulting in the formation of the Himalayas, has had profound impacts on both regional and global climates. The India-Asia collision is considered one of the largest continental collisions, with significant implications for the Earth’s climate and biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the Deccan volcanism and the movement of the Indian Plate had lasting effects on the Earth's biodiversity and climate. While the Deccan eruptions caused mass extinctions, they also paved the way for the flourishing of tropical ecosystems. Understanding the dynamics of these geological events helps us appreciate the resilience of ecosystems and the transformative power of volcanic activity.</p>
