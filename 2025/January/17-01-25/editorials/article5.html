        2024: The Year That Breached the 1.5°C Threshold
    </header>

<img alt="2024 Global Warming" src="https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/01/09/7ae1d381625a0655e5ac5c0c7f9859e01736447259846236_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&amp;imwidth=320"/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The year 2024 has now been confirmed to have breached the 1.5°C global warming threshold, becoming the first calendar year to do so. This milestone raises important questions about the long-term impacts of climate change and how it might influence future temperature trends. However, there are various perspectives on what this breach really means and what it signifies for the future.</p>
<h2>1.5°C: An Arbitrary Mark</h2>
<p>The 1.5-degree mark is often seen as a critical threshold, but in terms of climate change impacts, there is nothing specific that happens once this threshold is crossed. It is, after all, an arbitrary figure chosen by scientists and policymakers. The true implications of this threshold lie in understanding long-term trends rather than one-off events or annual measurements.</p>
<h2>Paris Agreement and Emission Cut Targets</h2>
<p>Even with the breach in 2024, the 1.5°C target outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement is still valid. However, this target is not meant to be achieved in a single year but refers to long-term temperature trends over multiple decades. Global emissions are still on the rise, and as of now, the targets set for 2030 appear increasingly unlikely to be met. This raises concerns that the breach observed in 2024 could become a regular occurrence within the next decade.</p>
<h2>2023 and 2024: Exceptionally Warm Years</h2>
<p>Both 2023 and 2024 have been exceptionally warm years. 2024, in fact, is now considered the warmest year on record, surpassing 2023, which was already 1.45 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels. Since July 2023, every month, except for July 2024, has been warmer than the corresponding month of pre-industrial times by more than 1.5°C.</p>
<h3>The Role of El Niño</h3>
<p>El Niño, a periodic oceanic phenomenon in the eastern Pacific Ocean, has contributed significantly to the warming observed in these years. El Niño generally causes global temperatures to rise, while its opposite, La Niña, results in cooler conditions. During 2023 and 2024, the prevailing El Niño event further amplified global temperatures.</p>
<h3>Other Contributing Factors</h3>
<p>Several additional factors may have contributed to this unprecedented warming. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unprecedented El Niño-like systems in other ocean regions.</li>
<li>An underwater volcanic eruption near Tonga in 2022.</li>
<li>Lower sulphur dioxide emissions from the shipping industry in 2024, which reduced the reflective properties of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere.</li>
<li>The Sun's solar maximum phase, which could have increased solar energy reaching Earth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Looking Ahead to 2025 and Beyond</h2>
<p>Despite the exceptional trends observed in 2023 and 2024, it is unlikely that these trends will continue in 2025. Temperatures in recent years have typically been between 1.1 and 1.4°C above pre-industrial levels, and it is expected that 2025 will follow this pattern. However, a recent report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) indicates a possibility that annual temperatures could reach as high as 1.9°C above pre-industrial levels in the years leading up to 2028. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the five-year average of temperatures will exceed the 1.5°C threshold by 2028.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
<ul>
<li>2024 is the first year to breach the 1.5°C threshold.</li>
<li>Despite this, the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goals remain intact.</li>
<li>El Niño and other factors have contributed significantly to the warming in recent years.</li>
<li>Future temperatures may continue to rise, but the exact trajectory remains uncertain.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="conclusion">
<p>In conclusion, while 2024 has marked a significant milestone in global warming, it is important to understand that this breach does not signal the end of efforts to mitigate climate change. It underscores the urgency of achieving emission reduction targets and emphasizes the need for more sustainable global practices.</p>
