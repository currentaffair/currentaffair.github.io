<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Legalising minimum support prices (MSPs) would be a folly; it would throw a spanner in the working of the economy. Making MSPs effective is different from making MSPs legal.</p>
<h2>Understanding Minimum Support Price (MSP)</h2>
<p>MSP is the price set by the government to ensure farmers receive a minimum profit for their produce. Currently, it is applicable to 23 crops.</p>
<h2>Purpose of MSP</h2>
<p>Introduced during the 1960s to address acute grain deficits. Primarily implemented for rice and wheat procurement in select states.</p>
<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>The Centreâ€™s latest Situation Assessment Survey revealed that not more than 10% of farmers sold their produce at MSP. The 23 MSP crops constitute roughly 30% of the value of agriculture.</p>
<h2>Arguments Against Legalising MSP</h2>
<h3>Market Distortion</h3>
<p>In a market economy, prices are determined by demand and supply. Legalising MSP disrupts this balance, especially when supply exceeds demand.</p>
<h3>Burden on Government</h3>
<p>The government would have to procure excess stock, incurring significant costs. The logistics of buying, storing, and distributing all excess produce are impractical.</p>
<h3>Trader-Farmer Collusion</h3>
<p>There is a high probability that farmers and traders will collude in showing market prices much lower than the MSP. This would make it very difficult to estimate the hit to the financial exchequer.</p>
<h3>Lessons from Past Attempts</h3>
<p>Madhya Pradesh's price deficiency payment scheme failed after one season due to market manipulation.</p>
<h2>Economic Challenges of MSP Legalisation</h2>
<h3>Fiscal Burden</h3>
<p>Open-ended procurement would strain the financial exchequer. Managing 23 MSP-covered crops across multiple states is logistically and financially unfeasible.</p>
<h3>Impact on Market-Based Growth</h3>
<p>Market-oriented segments like fisheries, meat, eggs, milk, and horticulture have grown at higher rates than MSP-backed crops like wheat and rice.</p>
<h3>Consumer Bias in Policy</h3>
<p>Government interventions (export bans, stocking limits) suppress market prices to control inflation, indirectly taxing agriculture. India is the only G20 country with negative Producer Support Estimates (PSEs), reflecting this bias.</p>
<h2>Way Forward: Alternative Approaches</h2>
<h3>Strengthen MSP Implementation</h3>
<p>Focus on making MSP more effective, not legal. Create a stabilisation fund of about Rs 25,000 crore, especially focused on pulses and oilseeds of which India is a net importer.</p>
<h3>Market-Based Solutions</h3>
<p>Develop agri-value chains akin to the AMUL model, ensuring farmers receive 75-80% of the consumer price. Liberalise agriculture by reducing government interference in export bans and stocking limits.</p>
<h3>Diversification of Agriculture</h3>
<p>Encourage farmers to shift toward high-growth sectors like fisheries, meat, and horticulture, which have performed better in a free-market system.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Making MSP legal will be going backwards, which is not in line with the liberalisation of the economy. India should focus on enhancing market-based systems, reducing government distortions, and building robust value chains to empower farmers.</p>
