    India's Rising Inequality: A Comprehensive Analysis

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Inclusive growth is critical for India to become a developed nation by 2047. Leading indicators of inclusive growth include the improvements in the living standards of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid and the direction of changes in income inequality.</p>
<h2>Key Findings on Income Distribution</h2>
<h3>Trends in Income Inequality</h3>
<p>Survey-based PRICE ICE360 data reveals a decline in income inequality, with the middle class expanding. However, reports claiming rising inequality often focus on the income shares of the richest 1%, derived from the World Inequality Lab (WIL), which can be misleading due to its methodological limitations.</p>
<h3>Limitations of WIL Estimates</h3>
<p>The WIL estimates often underestimate the income share of low and middle-income households. This happens because WIL assumes that 80% of households spend more than they earn, which inflates the income share of the top earners. From 2017 to 2022, the bottom 50% income share increased from 13.9% to 15%, while the top 10% share fell from 58.8% to 57.7%. These changes are overlooked in many reports.</p>
<p>Additionally, the WIL estimates fail to account for tax impacts, which have reduced inequality through measures like marginal tax rate reductions and improved tax administration since 2014. This adjustment results in higher reported top incomes, without necessarily indicating rising inequality.</p>
<h2>Post-Tax Income Realities</h2>
<p>Despite higher top incomes, the top 1% of individual taxpayers contribute 42% of total income tax, highlighting a significant disparity in post-tax disposable income. Welfare transfers to lower-income households have substantially augmented their actual incomes, mitigating inequality.</p>
<h2>Economic Factors Influencing Inequality</h2>
<h3>Growth vs. Return on Capital</h3>
<p>Higher GDP growth has outpaced real returns on capital, benefitting labor over capital and reducing inequality. Weighted real lending rates and adjusted returns on equity remain below GDP growth rates, thus promoting inclusivity.</p>
<h3>Role of Mutual Funds and Start-Ups</h3>
<p>Investment in mutual funds and start-ups has expanded wealth across a broader base. Over 14% of Indian households benefit from mutual fund investments, with high returns from small-cap and start-up ventures. The rise of first-generation billionaires in India demonstrates the success of wealth creation beyond inherited assets.</p>
<h2>Improvements in Living Standards</h2>
<h3>Near-Eradication of Extreme Poverty</h3>
<p>According to NSSO data (2011–12 to 2023–24), poverty has reduced significantly, with improved consumption patterns, especially for the bottom 20% of households. The economic mobility reflected in these trends showcases the success of inclusive growth strategies.</p>
<h3>Healthier Food Consumption</h3>
<p>Increased consumption of milk products, meat, fish, and fresh fruits, particularly in rural households, is a testament to improving living standards. Welfare programs have also contributed to dietary improvements for economically disadvantaged groups.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Ownership Growth</h3>
<p>Among the poorest 20% of households, vehicle ownership rose from 6% in 2011–12 to 40% in 2023, indicating upward mobility and access to better living standards.</p>
<h3>Higher Enrolment Rates</h3>
<p>There have been substantial increases in the gross enrolment ratios for SC and ST students, demonstrating improved access to education for disadvantaged groups.</p>
<h2>Way Forward: Implications for Sustained Inclusive Growth</h2>
<h3>Focus on Equitable Distribution</h3>
<p>Improving methodologies for income distribution estimates can help present a clearer picture of inequality. Enhancing welfare transfers and ensuring equitable access to resources for disadvantaged groups are key to sustaining inclusive growth.</p>
<h3>Strengthen Economic Dynamism</h3>
<p>Promoting start-ups and small-cap investments will foster wealth creation across broader segments of the population. Reducing barriers to entry for mid-tier businesses is essential to sustain competition and innovation.</p>
<h3>Supportive Governance</h3>
<p>Governments must continue focusing on poverty alleviation through effective welfare programs and policies that prioritize labor-intensive growth to ensure broader participation in economic gains.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Improvements in living standards, poverty reduction, and educational gains demonstrate a move towards an equitable society. Consistent efforts are required to address the systemic gaps and maintain the momentum towards achieving Viksit Bharat.</p>
