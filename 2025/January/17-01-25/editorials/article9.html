    The Leaders Our Universities Need
</header>
<section>
<img alt="University Leaders" src="https://research.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/Prasant-Mohapatra-feature.jpg"/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
        The University Grants Commission (UGC) has drafted new regulations aimed at aligning higher education standards with the National Education Policy (NEP). These regulations focus on improving the hiring and promotion processes for teachers and academic staff, as well as redefining the leadership roles in universities, particularly the position of Vice-Chancellor (VC).
    </p>
<h2>The Significance of the Post of Vice-Chancellor (VC)</h2>
<p>
        The VC’s post is central to the functioning of a university. As the academic and administrative head of the university, the VC chairs important bodies such as the council of the university, the board of faculties, and the finance committee. The VC is also responsible for representing the university externally, both within the country and abroad. A key part of the VC's role is to secure the university’s financial foundation, ensuring that the institution can achieve its mission, aims, and objectives. The mandate of the VC is to create knowledge for the benefit of humanity and the universe.
    </p>
<h2>The Mandate of Recent Regulation</h2>
<p>
        The new regulations aim to clarify the formation of the search-cum-selection committee responsible for appointing VCs. These powers are now vested in the Governor-Chancellors or Visitors. The previous practice required the government to nominate a representative from a list of three names. Under the new regulation, the Governor-Chancellor will have the authority to nominate a representative. This change has sparked concerns from state governments, which feel they no longer have a voice in selecting the VC.
    </p>
<h2>Recent Controversy Regarding the Vice-Chancellor Post</h2>
<p>
        The VC’s post has become a topic of debate in recent years. Some state governments have attempted to replace the Governor-Chancellor with a Chief Minister-Chancellor. This shift is ironic because the President of India and Governors were originally assigned this role to keep politics separate from university administration. The growing politicization of the VC position raises important concerns about the future of higher education governance.
    </p>
<h2>Need for Flexibility in VC Appointments</h2>
<p>
        The Kalyani Mathivanan vs State (2015) case highlighted the need for flexibility in VC appointments. The court emphasized that flexibility is necessary, but it should not compromise the “eminence” of the position. The UGC draft proposes opening up the VC post to individuals from industries, the public sector, and senior administrators. This bold move aims to bring in new perspectives, but it also raises concerns about resistance from vested interests that may interfere with the process.
    </p>
<h2>Selection of Vice-Chancellor (VC) in Universities: Key Practices</h2>
<h3>Search Committee Composition</h3>
<p class="highlight">
<b>In the US:</b> Includes senior administrators (provosts, deans), faculty representatives, staff members, students (occasionally), and trustees or board members.
    </p>
<p class="highlight">
<b>In the UK:</b> Composed of university governors/trustees, senior leaders (Pro-VCs, Deputy VCs), faculty representatives, and external advisors or search firms. This model ensures inclusivity and transparency by including faculty and students in the process.
    </p>
<h3>Executive Titles in Prestigious Institutions</h3>
<p>
        Universities such as MIT and Stanford use titles like Chancellor or President for their highest executive roles, which reflects the importance of leadership in shaping the university's direction.
    </p>
<h3>Search Committee Processes</h3>
<p class="important">
<b>Engagement with Stakeholders:</b> Search committees in the US and UK consult with university constituencies to identify the qualifications and qualities required for leadership roles.
    </p>
<p>
<b>Candidate Evaluation:</b> Formal interviews, background checks, and thorough assessments are conducted to evaluate the suitability of candidates for the VC position.
    </p>
<h3>Governance and Regulations</h3>
<p>
        In the US and UK, there are no overarching regulators for VC appointments, allowing universities to follow their own internal processes and governance models.
    </p>
<h2>Some Reforms in New UGC Draft</h2>
<p>
        The draft regulations include progressive measures such as waiving the requirement for the UGC-NET exam for assistant professors in technical institutions. The draft also proposes removing the cap on contract teacher appointments, which is in line with the NEP's objectives of addressing faculty shortages in universities.
    </p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>
        While the optimism surrounding these reforms is shared by many, it is important to consider whether India’s universities are aligned with best practices globally. With universities facing funding shortages, the inclusion of professionals from outside academia could bring fresh perspectives, but it is essential that these individuals understand the unique ethos of the university system to be effective leaders.
    </p>
<h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
        The challenge for Vice-Chancellors, irrespective of their appointment process, is to enhance research standards and drive internationalization. If successful, these efforts could elevate the global standing of Indian universities, making them more competitive and attractive on the world stage. It is hoped that the proposed regulations will help achieve this vision.
