<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The downward revision of India’s growth prospects to 6.4% in FY 25, down from 8.2%, marks the lowest growth forecast since the pandemic. This decline signals broader issues within the economy, raising questions about its structural strength and resilience in the face of global uncertainties.</p>
<h2>Key Issues in India’s Economic Growth</h2>
<h3>Cyclical Narrative</h3>
<p>The reduction in growth projections highlights several key issues affecting India’s economy. A lack of strong data-driven tools to predict economic cycles reflects a weak analytical framework. High growth spurts tend to be short-lived in India, pointing to concerns over the sustainability of economic booms. Furthermore, the growing uncertainty around growth and inflation strategies casts doubt on the government's ability to manage these dynamics effectively.</p>
<h3>Overdependence on Public Spending</h3>
<p>The government's reliance on favorable weather conditions and public spending, such as in infrastructure and monsoon-dependent sectors, reflects a structural weakness. Key sectors like the private sector and consumer consumption remain stagnant, revealing a decade-long stagnation. Additionally, large investments in infrastructure, such as roads and railways, often lack a clear framework for assessing long-term productivity gains and efficiency.</p>
<h3>Emerging Investor Concerns</h3>
<p>Investor confidence has been affected by inefficiency in capital expenditure priorities. While large infrastructure projects are being pursued, smaller, high-efficiency investments are being neglected. Additionally, governance failures in schemes like Swachh Bharat and Namami Gange, alongside regulatory complexity and a resurgence in retail-level corruption, have created an environment of uncertainty. The concentration of economic power within a few corporate players has stifled competition and innovation.</p>
<h3>Structural Challenges in India’s Economy</h3>
<p>The private sector faces limitations despite available capital, as companies struggle to identify viable projects. Wages have remained stagnant, household savings are declining, and debt defaults are on the rise, indicating a financial squeeze on India’s middle class. The construction sector, while providing employment, fails to build long-term human capital, as skill development remains insufficient to meet the demands of higher-value jobs.</p>
<h2>Way Forward: Policy Implications and Recommendations</h2>
<h3>Reassessing Capex Strategy</h3>
<p>India must reassess its capital expenditure (CapEx) strategy by conducting comprehensive assessments of infrastructure projects. This should ensure that investments yield higher productivity and human capital development, as well as measurable economic returns.</p>
<h3>Simplifying Governance and Regulation</h3>
<p>Streamlining the tax and regulatory policies to reduce complexity is crucial for fostering investor confidence. The government must address corruption issues at both the centralized and transactional levels to restore credibility in governance.</p>
<h3>Broadening Economic Participation</h3>
<p>India should promote competition by reducing its reliance on a few dominant corporate players. Mid-sized enterprises must be encouraged through fair treatment and reduced fears of expropriation. Such efforts can promote a more diverse and resilient economy.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Structural Resilience</h3>
<p>Policies that focus on boosting private sector capital formation, increasing wages, and reviving manufacturing are essential. Strengthening governance mechanisms to execute public schemes effectively is also critical for ensuring sustained benefits across sectors.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>India faces a real growth opportunity, but the current slowdown is a signal of declining confidence in the government. It is not merely a cyclical phenomenon, but a deeper reflection of structural weaknesses within the economy.</p>
