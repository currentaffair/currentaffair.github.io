<p><strong>News Context:</strong> The US withdrawal from the WHO underlines the need for global health leadership, as its departure disrupts funding and expertise crucial to WHO's functioning. While the WHO faces criticism for bureaucracy, political influences, and declining efficiency, its role in addressing global health challenges remains critical. India's relatively small but impactful contributions, particularly in traditional medicine and digital health, highlight its growing potential in global health governance. With reforms in global health institutions on the horizon, India can leverage its expertise and innovative health solutions to emerge as a leader. This moment presents India with an opportunity to champion equitable and sustainable global health practices.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) has cast a shadow over global health leadership, emphasizing the importance of international cooperation in tackling health crises. While the WHO’s influence is often criticized for inefficiency and bureaucracy, its role in managing global health challenges remains irreplaceable. India, though still a relatively small player in global health, has shown promise in contributing innovative health solutions, particularly in traditional medicine and digital health, paving the way for a more prominent role in the global health governance landscape.</p>

<h2>Key Achievements of India in Healthcare and Governance</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Democratization of Healthcare: </strong> One of India's major achievements in health care is Ayushman Bharat, launched in 2018. The scheme has successfully covered over 36 crore beneficiaries (as of 2024), ensuring free hospitalization for economically disadvantaged families. The program addresses both primary and secondary healthcare needs, bridging the gap between urban and rural healthcare accessibility. Notably, Ayushman Bharat has contributed to a 21% reduction in out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, offering financial relief to millions of families.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Unparalleled Vaccine Coverage and Disease Elimination: </strong> India's immunization program has made significant strides in eliminating diseases like polio and neonatal tetanus. The successful Covid-19 vaccination campaign reached nearly 97% of eligible beneficiaries by January 2023, with approximately 90% fully vaccinated. Additionally, the Mission Indradhanush program increased full immunization rates from 62% in 2015-16 to 76.4% in 2019-21, showcasing India's capacity to respond to public health challenges.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Strengthening Rural Healthcare Infrastructure: </strong> India has operationalized 1.72 lakh Ayushman Arogya Mandir centers under the Ayushman Bharat program, serving rural and underserved populations. These centers provide primary healthcare services, maternal health, and non-communicable disease screenings, benefiting millions and contributing to the improvement of health outcomes in rural areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Health Digitization through the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM): </strong> The NDHM, launched in 2020, has revolutionized healthcare delivery by enabling electronic health records and telemedicine services. By the end of 2024, over 17,000 facilities across India had integrated digital health services, saving time and improving access to healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Focus on Traditional Medicine through AYUSH Integration: </strong> India's leadership in traditional medicine is exemplified by the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine, which opened in Gujarat in 2022. The AYUSH sector has grown significantly, contributing $18 billion to the economy in 2021, with initiatives promoting wellness and preventive care through yoga and Ayurveda.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Innovative Health Financing for Equity: </strong> India's public healthcare expenditure has increased significantly, with the 2022-23 budget allocating 2.1% of GDP for health. This increase is coupled with health financing mechanisms such as the Health and Education Cess, ensuring sustained investment in health infrastructure and welfare programs.</p>
</div>

<h2>Major Challenges Holding Back India's Leadership in Global Health</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Insufficient Health Expenditure: </strong> Despite improvements, India's public health expenditure still falls short of the WHO recommendation of 5% of GDP. This gap affects infrastructure, research, and human resources, limiting India’s ability to lead on the global stage. Furthermore, inefficiencies in schemes like Ayushman Bharat, such as ineligible beneficiaries receiving benefits, reduce the credibility of India’s healthcare system.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Weak R&amp;D in Healthcare Innovations: </strong> India's healthcare R&amp;D ecosystem remains underdeveloped, with a significant gap in funding for innovation. The country ranks 40th in the Global Innovation Index 2023, reflecting limited investment in advanced medical research, particularly in emerging diseases and technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Lack of Comprehensive Regulatory Frameworks: </strong> India's health regulatory framework remains fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in drug approval and public health crisis management. Cases like the cough syrup controversy in 2023 have highlighted critical gaps in quality assurance and the need for a more robust regulatory system.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Disparities in Health Infrastructure: </strong> Regional imbalances in healthcare infrastructure are a major challenge. While some states like Kerala show exemplary health outcomes, others, especially in northern India, continue to struggle with high infant mortality rates and lower life expectancy, exacerbating health inequities across the country.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Challenges in Pandemic Preparedness: </strong> Despite India's success in managing the Covid-19 pandemic, gaps in pandemic preparedness persist, such as fragmented surveillance systems and inadequate coordination across states, which hampers the country’s ability to respond swiftly to future health crises.</p>
</div>

<h2>How India Can Emerge as a Global Health Leader</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Strengthening Research and Development (R&amp;D) in Health Innovation: </strong> India must invest in healthcare R&amp;D to become a global leader in medical innovation. Initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for pharmaceuticals can stimulate the production of complex generics and biosimilars, strengthening India’s position in the global healthcare market.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Develop Regional Biotech Clusters for Global Health: </strong> By establishing biotech hubs in cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad, India can become a global center for healthcare research. These clusters should be supported by collaboration between academia, government, and private industry to drive innovation in biotechnology and precision medicine.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Leverage Digital Health to Improve Accessibility: </strong> India should expand the scope of the National Digital Health Mission to provide services to neighboring countries, particularly in the Global South. By promoting telemedicine and health-tech innovations, India can enhance global health accessibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Integrating AYUSH with Modern Medicine: </strong> Promoting the integration of AYUSH systems with modern allopathic medicine will enhance the global credibility of traditional Indian healthcare. Expanding research into evidence-based practices in yoga and Ayurveda will position India as a leader in holistic health solutions.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<p>India’s journey toward becoming a global health leader involves capitalizing on its strengths in vaccine diplomacy, digital health, and traditional medicine while addressing critical gaps in healthcare infrastructure, expenditure, and R&amp;D. By strengthening research, improving regulatory frameworks, and promoting health equity both domestically and globally, India has the potential to drive sustainable and inclusive health governance on the world stage. With continued investments and strategic reforms, India can transform global health systems and become a model of health leadership.</p>
