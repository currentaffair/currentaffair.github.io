Despite this centralized control, India's nuclear sector struggles with inefficiencies and delays in project execution, which has hindered its growth.</p>
</div>
<h3>Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010</h3>
<p>The Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010, limits the liability of nuclear operators to ₹1,500 crore, with the government acting as a backstop in case of a major accident. This framework, along with the India Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP), offers insurance coverage for nuclear accidents. However, this law has faced criticism for its limitations and concerns about whether it provides adequate protection in case of a significant nuclear disaster.</p>
<h3>International Compliance</h3>
<p>India's nuclear energy sector operates under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) due to the Indo-US Civil Nuclear Agreement. While India adheres to these international standards, it maintains its strategic autonomy by not being a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This strategic stance gives India the flexibility to pursue its nuclear ambitions while balancing global and national interests.</p>

<h2>Significance of Nuclear Energy for India</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p>Nuclear energy holds great promise for India, especially in terms of energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic growth. With an expanding population and energy demands, nuclear power is a vital tool in diversifying India's energy mix and reducing its dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p>
</div>
<h3>Diversification of Energy Mix</h3>
<p>Currently, coal accounts for 55% of India's energy needs, with a heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Nuclear energy offers a stable and reliable alternative that can mitigate risks associated with volatile fossil fuel markets. As of May 2023, nuclear power contributed 1.6% of India's energy generation, and the country plans to increase this contribution significantly. The target is to expand nuclear capacity from 7.5 GW to 100 GW by 2047, with projections for nuclear energy to supply 25% of India's electricity by 2050.</p>
<h3>Climate Change Mitigation</h3>
<p>As India works toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, nuclear energy's role becomes even more critical. With minimal CO₂ emissions, nuclear power is essential for decarbonizing the energy sector, reducing reliance on coal, and balancing the intermittency of renewable energy sources. India's commitment to having 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy by 2030 includes nuclear energy as a major player, contributing 22.48 GW by 2031-32.</p>
<h3>Reducing Import Dependence</h3>
<p>India currently imports over 85% of its crude oil and 50% of its natural gas. Nuclear energy, particularly domestic advancements in technologies like the Fast Breeder Reactor, reduces this dependency and strengthens India's energy security. This helps shield the economy from price fluctuations and geopolitical risks associated with energy imports.</p>
<h3>Economic Growth and Job Creation</h3>
<p>The nuclear sector provides a significant boost to economic growth, generating jobs in construction, operation, and manufacturing. Projects like the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant and Bharat Small Modular Reactors (BSMRs) offer opportunities for innovation and employment, helping local economies thrive.</p>
<h3>Base-Load Energy Support for Renewables</h3>
<p>Unlike solar and wind, which are intermittent, nuclear power provides consistent base-load electricity. This is essential for stabilizing the grid as renewable energy capacity expands. With India's energy demand expected to double by 2070, nuclear power will play a key role in ensuring a reliable and resilient energy supply.</p>
<h3>Geopolitical Leverage and Strategic Alliances</h3>
<p>India's growing nuclear capabilities enhance its position in global energy geopolitics, fostering partnerships and strengthening its diplomatic standing. Technological achievements, such as the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, help India counter strategic vulnerabilities and negotiate better terms in international energy agreements.</p>
