<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court of India recently made a landmark ruling in the Rajive Raturi v. Union of India case, 2024, invalidating Rule 15 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Rules, 2017. This ruling holds significant implications for the accessibility measures for persons with disabilities in India, aligning the legal framework with the statutory mandates of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. This case emphasizes the need for comprehensive accessibility measures and mandatory guidelines to ensure equality and inclusion for persons with disabilities (PwDs) across the country.</p>

<h2>Why SC Invalidated Rule 15 of RPwD Rules, 2017?</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p>Rule 15 of the RPwD Rules, 2017, was designed to establish accessibility guidelines across various government departments, granting ministries the authority to issue guidelines for accessibility. However, the Supreme Court found that this rule contradicted the mandatory provisions of the RPwD Act. While the Act requires the government to ensure accessibility, Rule 15 adopted a discretionary approach, which was inconsistent with the statutory provisions of the Act.</p>
</div>
<p>The Court emphasized the need for a binding obligation rather than a discretionary approach to ensure the effective implementation of accessibility measures. The RPwD Act mandates regular social audits to ensure that government schemes and policies do not adversely affect persons with disabilities. The lack of standardized guidelines under the RPwD Rules had led to inconsistency in conducting these audits, further exacerbating the challenges faced by PwDs.</p>

<h2>Accessibility Vs Reasonable Accommodation</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p>The Supreme Court also drew a distinction between two important concepts: accessibility and reasonable accommodation. Accessibility refers to the universal design principles that ensure spaces, services, and digital platforms are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. On the other hand, reasonable accommodation addresses the specific needs of individuals with disabilities to ensure they can fully participate in society.</p>
</div>
<p>Both accessibility and reasonable accommodation are crucial for achieving substantive equality under constitutional principles. The Court's ruling underscores that the implementation of universal accessibility measures must be complemented by tailored accommodations for individuals to ensure they can exercise their rights on an equal footing with others.</p>

<h2>Need for New Guidelines</h2>
<p>In light of the Supreme Court's observations, the government has been directed to establish new, mandatory accessibility guidelines within three months. These guidelines must focus on four key principles:</p>
<div class="important">
<ul>
<li><strong>Universal Design for All:</strong> Accessibility must be integrated into the design of infrastructure and services from the outset, ensuring that everyone, including persons with disabilities, can access public spaces and services.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Inclusion:</strong> The guidelines must ensure that all types of disabilities are addressed, including physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Assistive Technologies:</strong> The integration of assistive technologies such as screen readers, accessible digital platforms, and other adaptive technologies is crucial for ensuring full participation of PwDs in society.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Consultation:</strong> Continuous dialogue with persons with disabilities must be established to ensure that accessibility measures remain relevant and effective in meeting their needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act)</h2>
<p>The RPwD Act, 2016, is a landmark piece of legislation aimed at protecting the rights of persons with disabilities in India and ensuring their full participation in society. The Act was formulated to give effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which India ratified in 2007. The RPwD Act encompasses a wide range of provisions that safeguard the rights of PwDs, including access to education, employment, and public services.</p>
<p>The Act defines disability as an evolving and dynamic concept and expanded the recognized categories from seven to twenty-one, including disabilities such as blindness, leprosy, hearing impairment, locomotor disability, and mental illnesses, among others. The Act mandates the government to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy their rights on an equal basis with others, addressing areas such as education, employment, and accessibility.</p>

<h2>Challenges Faced by Persons with Disabilities</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p>Despite the legislative framework, persons with disabilities in India face several significant challenges, including inaccessible infrastructure, educational exclusion, and employment discrimination. A 2018 report by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities found that only 3% of buildings in India were fully accessible, highlighting the lack of infrastructure to accommodate PwDs.</p>
</div>
<p>In terms of education, the literacy rate for PwDs remains low, with only 55% of the PwD population being literate. Furthermore, employment opportunities for PwDs are limited due to workplace discrimination, inadequate accommodations, and societal prejudices. Despite 1.3 crore PwDs being employable, only 34 lakh are employed, pointing to the significant barriers they face in securing stable employment.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p>To address the challenges faced by persons with disabilities, the following measures are crucial:</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessible Infrastructure:</strong> Improving disability-friendly public infrastructure, including ramps, tactile paths, and adaptive technologies, is essential for enhancing accessibility for PwDs.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing Prosthetics R&amp;D:</strong> Increasing funding for prosthetics research and establishing centers for innovation in artificial limbs can significantly improve the quality of life for PwDs.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporating Gig Economy Platforms:</strong> Creating dedicated platforms within gig economy apps for PwDs, with support for sign language and AI-assisted task matching, can help enhance job opportunities for PwDs.</li>
<li><strong>Political Reservation:</strong> Introducing a reservation system in legislatures and local bodies for PwDs would ensure their representation and participation in decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<p>The Supreme Court's ruling on the RPwD Rules, 2017, marks a critical step in ensuring that persons with disabilities are provided equal opportunities and rights under the law. The need for mandatory accessibility guidelines, regular audits, and comprehensive consultation with PwDs is paramount to achieving a truly inclusive society. The government must take immediate steps to create a more accessible environment, empowering persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in society.</p>
