<p><strong>News Context:</strong>Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading infectious disease killer globally as per the 2024 WHO report. India accounts for 26% of the global TB burden, with high cases of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) and TB-related deaths. India pledged to achieve the “End TB” targets by 2025, but the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted efforts.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most challenging public health crises globally, and India faces a significant burden, accounting for a substantial portion of the world's TB cases. Despite the nation’s ambitious goals to eliminate TB by 2025, several factors have hindered progress. Understanding the challenges and opportunities surrounding India's "End TB" targets is essential to devising effective strategies for the future. This article analyzes the key challenges and explores potential opportunities to achieve the 2025 TB elimination target.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>End TB Targets and Current Progress</h2>
<p>The "End TB" targets set by India include:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% reduction in TB deaths</li>
<li>80% reduction in new TB cases</li>
<li>Zero TB-affected families facing catastrophic health expenses by 2030</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight">
<p>Current progress towards these targets has shown a 24% decline in TB-related deaths from 2015 to 2023, but much more needs to be done. Despite positive steps, India is far from meeting the ambitious goals set for 2025.</p>

<h2>Challenges in TB Elimination in India</h2>
<h3>Vulnerable Groups</h3>
<p>India's population includes several high-risk groups that are more susceptible to TB, such as miners, stone carvers, undernourished individuals, and those with co-morbidities like diabetes. Migrant workers face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, further exacerbating their vulnerability to TB due to lack of continuity in treatment and mobility.</p>
<h3>Undernutrition and Socioeconomic Factors</h3>
<p>Undernutrition, silicosis (lung disease), and overcrowded living conditions increase the likelihood of TB transmission and worsen patient outcomes. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-sectoral approach beyond the healthcare system, encompassing policy changes in food security, housing, and social welfare.</p>
<h3>Supply Chain Gaps</h3>
<div class="important">
<p>While India has achieved a 95% treatment initiation rate, the TB drug supply chain is plagued by disruptions. In 2023, shortages of key medications forced patients to buy medicines out-of-pocket, leading to catastrophic healthcare costs and the risk of antibiotic resistance.</p>
</div>
<h3>Extrapulmonary TB (EP-TB)</h3>
<p>Extrapulmonary TB, which affects organs other than the lungs, constitutes 24% of all notified TB cases in India. It is often underdiagnosed due to its non-specific and vague symptoms. The lack of proper training for general practitioners and frontline workers results in delayed diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<h3>Diagnostic Challenges</h3>
<p>Access to molecular diagnostic tools like CBNAAT and Truenat is limited, especially in rural areas. Shortages of trained healthcare professionals and supply chain issues exacerbate delays in diagnosis, increasing patient expenses and leading to late-stage TB diagnoses.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Administrative and Programmatic Gaps</h2>
<p>Frequent updates to national TB guidelines are not matched by adequate training for healthcare workers. Additionally, local ownership of TB programs remains insufficient in many regions. A successful case study from Idukki, Kerala, demonstrated the importance of community participation through the Kudumbashree initiative, which has contributed to greater program ownership at the local level.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>International Case Study: Vietnam</h2>
<p>Vietnam has achieved significant success in TB elimination by implementing active case finding, particularly among high-risk groups. This approach has led to better outcomes and could serve as a model for India to restructure its TB elimination strategy.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Progress and Opportunities</h2>
<p>Despite the challenges, India has made considerable progress in TB case notification, reaching its highest level to date. The decrease in TB deaths demonstrates the potential for improvement with well-targeted interventions.</p>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>India's efforts to achieve the "End TB" targets by 2025 face significant hurdles, including vulnerable groups, socioeconomic factors, gaps in supply chains, and diagnostic challenges. However, by addressing these issues through multi-sectoral actions and leveraging successful models like that of Vietnam, India can accelerate its TB elimination efforts. With continued focus on program implementation and strategic investments, the target of eliminating TB by 2025 remains within reach.</p>
