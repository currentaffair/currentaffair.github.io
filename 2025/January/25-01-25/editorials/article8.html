<p><strong>News Context:</strong>The US under President Donald Trump has implemented a series of significant policy shifts, including revoking birthright citizenship, exiting the Paris Agreement, pulling out of the World Health Organization (WHO), and rejecting the Global Corporate Minimum Tax (GCMT) deal. These changes have far-reaching implications, especially for India and its global positioning across climate policy, healthcare, immigration, and taxation.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump's executive decisions have created ripples across the globe, especially affecting India. Policies such as the revocation of birthright citizenship, withdrawal from global climate accords, and the US's exit from the WHO and rejection of global tax reforms are reshaping the relationship between the two nations. The implications of these actions are not only political but extend into the social, environmental, and economic sectors, requiring a critical reassessment of India's foreign policies and strategies.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Revocation of Birthright Citizenship</h2>
<p>The revocation of birthright citizenship by the US impacts a significant demographic group, particularly Indian immigrants. Birthright citizenship grants automatic citizenship to children born on US soil, regardless of parental nationality. Trump's executive order seeks to restrict this privilege, notably targeting birth tourism, where expectant mothers travel to the US to ensure US citizenship for their children. This policy shift carries profound consequences for families, especially those of Indian origin, who may face uncertainties regarding citizenship status.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Impact on Indian H-1B Visa Holders:</strong> Indian professionals on H-1B visas and Green Card applicants may face challenges, with children born in the US losing automatic citizenship. This could potentially disrupt family dynamics and reduce long-term migration to the US. As a result, many Indians might consider alternative destinations like Canada, the UK, or Australia with more favorable immigration policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Legal Challenges:</strong> The move directly conflicts with the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to all born on American soil. Legal challenges are likely, and this could further complicate the situation for affected families.</p>

<h2>US Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement</h2>
<p>The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, represents a collective effort to limit global warming and mitigate climate change. With the US, one of the largest contributors to global emissions, withdrawing from the accord, it significantly impacts the international community, including India. The withdrawal affects not just climate policies but also financial commitments for developing nations like India that rely on global climate funds.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>US Role in Global Emission Reduction:</strong> The US, as the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, plays a pivotal role in global efforts to reduce emissions. Its exit from the Paris Agreement has diminished international momentum towards achieving global climate goals. The reduction in climate finance, especially for adaptation and renewable energy projects, also poses a challenge for India’s own climate policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Implications for India:</strong> India, which has committed to ambitious renewable energy targets, faces potential setbacks in funding and support for green projects. While India can continue to pursue its climate goals, the loss of US leadership in global climate finance will require India to seek new partnerships and avenues for funding.</p>
</div>

<section>
<h2>Impact of US Withdrawal from WHO</h2>
<p>The US's decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) has significant implications for global health governance. The US is a major contributor to WHO funding and provides vital expertise in global health matters. Its departure risks destabilizing WHO’s capacity to respond to health crises, such as pandemics, which could affect India's health programs and global health initiatives.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Impact on India:</strong> India, with its large population and public health challenges, stands to face the consequences of the weakened WHO. Reduced funding and expertise from the US could hinder global health efforts, especially in areas such as HIV, tuberculosis, and pandemic preparedness.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>WHO’s Role in Global Health:</strong> The WHO has played a key role in combating diseases across the globe, including in India. The US’s withdrawal could create a funding vacuum that would make it more difficult for WHO to coordinate efforts effectively, with countries like India potentially needing to step up their leadership roles in global health governance.</p>
</div>

<h2>Rejection of the Global Corporate Minimum Tax Deal</h2>
<p>The Global Corporate Minimum Tax (GCMT) deal was designed to ensure multinational corporations pay a minimum tax in each jurisdiction they operate, preventing tax havens from undermining global tax systems. The US’s rejection of the GCMT has complicated global tax reforms, potentially impacting international consensus and the efforts of countries like India to stabilize global tax competition.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Global Consensus:</strong> The US withdrawal from the GCMT deal has set back efforts to stabilize international tax competition. Without US participation, the deal’s impact on multinational corporations will be less comprehensive, leaving countries like India to navigate a more fragmented tax landscape.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Impact on India:</strong> While India's tax policies may not be significantly impacted in the short term, the country’s "wait and watch" approach suggests it will observe how the US’s rejection of the deal affects the global tax system. India could take a leadership role in tax reforms if global consensus falters.</p>

<h2>India's Response to US Policy Shifts</h2>
<p>India must navigate these shifting US policies with strategic diplomacy, focusing on areas where it can assert its own influence. India’s approach should be multifaceted, involving advocacy for Indian immigrants, bolstering climate leadership, and strengthening its position in global health and tax reform discussions.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Advocacy and Diplomacy:</strong> India must leverage its diplomatic channels to protect the rights of its diaspora, advocating for fair immigration policies in the US. Additionally, India can enhance its strategic ties with the US through multilateral platforms like the Quad, which could counterbalance China’s influence in the region.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Climate Action:</strong> India should continue to drive its renewable energy transition and seek collaborations with other countries committed to climate action. Working with the European Union and Japan, for instance, can help mitigate the loss of US-backed climate finance and ensure the continuation of green projects in India.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Global Health Leadership:</strong> India’s healthcare expertise, demonstrated during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, positions it as a leader in global health governance. With the US stepping back from WHO, India can assert a stronger role in shaping global health policies and advocating for the needs of developing nations.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The policy shifts implemented by the US under President Trump have complex and far-reaching implications for India. From immigration and health to climate action and global taxation, these changes necessitate a recalibration of India’s strategies in diplomacy, climate policy, and international relations. As global power dynamics shift, India has the opportunity to step into a leadership role, advocating for sustainable practices, a stronger health framework, and a more inclusive global tax system.</p>
