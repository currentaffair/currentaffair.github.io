<p><strong>News Context:</strong>The global burden of tuberculosis (TB) remains high, with India facing significant challenges. Despite political commitments, achieving the End TB targets by 2025 seems unlikely, but there is a glimmer of hope.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be the leading infectious disease killer worldwide. Despite the ambitious "End TB" targets set by the World Health Organization (WHO), including a 90% reduction in TB deaths and an 80% reduction in new cases by 2030, these goals remain far from achievable, especially in India. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global health efforts, pushing back timelines for TB elimination. India, the country with the highest TB burden, faces challenges ranging from high rates of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) to inadequate healthcare infrastructure. This article explores these challenges, the role of vulnerable populations, India's achievements in treatment, and the steps needed to overcome these obstacles.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Focus on Vulnerable Groups</h2>
<p>India's fight against TB requires an understanding of the vulnerable populations most at risk. These groups include migrant workers, people with severe lung damage from working in mining industries, and those with co-morbidities such as diabetes. Vulnerable populations are particularly susceptible to contracting TB and experiencing adverse outcomes due to socio-economic factors and limited access to healthcare.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>High-Risk Groups for TB include migrant workers, those exposed to silica dust, and individuals with undernutrition or poor immune systems.</p>
</div>
<h3>Silicosis and Mining</h3>
<p>Mining activities, especially in areas with significant stone carving operations, expose workers to fine dust particles, leading to conditions like silicosis. This lung disease significantly increases the risk of developing TB. The government must take action to mitigate these risks by improving safety standards in these industries.</p>
<h3>Nutrition and Co-morbidities</h3>
<p>Undernutrition and uncontrolled co-morbidities like diabetes exacerbate TB outcomes. A focus on improving nutrition and managing these diseases is critical in reducing TB incidence and mortality.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Multisectoral Action to Address Contributory Factors</h2>
<p>Tackling TB requires a coordinated, multisectoral approach. Addressing contributory factors such as undernutrition and overcrowding is essential for reducing the burden of TB. Initiatives must also consider the unique geographical and socio-economic factors that affect different regions of India.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>Local geography-specific actions should target issues such as overcrowding in urban slums and poor sanitation in rural areas.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h2>India's Achievements in TB Treatment</h2>
<h3>Treatment Initiation Success</h3>
<p>India has made significant strides in TB treatment. More than 95% of TB cases have treatment initiated, a commendable achievement. However, challenges remain in ensuring that all patients complete their treatment course and remain adherent to medication.</p>
<h3>Procurement &amp; Supply Chain</h3>
<p>The National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) has set up a dedicated procurement and supply chain system to ensure that TB drugs are available throughout the country. However, disruptions in the supply chain continue to pose challenges, particularly in remote areas.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Challenges in 2023 - Break in the Supply Chain</h2>
<p>The disruption of drug supplies in 2023, exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has affected many parts of the country. This shortage has made it difficult for TB patients to access the essential drugs they need.</p>
<div class="important">
<p>The shortage of critical TB drugs not only hampers treatment but also poses a risk of antibiotic resistance, which could complicate future treatment options.</p>
</div>
<h3>Impact on Patients</h3>
<p>Patients have had to either wait for drug supplies or seek alternatives, leading to catastrophic health expenses. This has further strained families already burdened by the economic costs of illness.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Extrapulmonary TB (EP-TB)</h2>
<p>Extrapulmonary TB (EP-TB) affects organs outside the lungs, such as the brain, bones, and skin. EP-TB accounts for approximately 24% of notified TB cases in India, although the proportion varies by geography.</p>
<h3>Challenges in Diagnosis</h3>
<p>EP-TB is often difficult to diagnose due to vague symptoms that mimic other diseases. Delayed diagnosis can lead to more severe disease and complications. It is crucial to train healthcare providers to identify TB cases early, even when symptoms are not typical.</p>
<h3>Diagnosis Accuracy</h3>
<p>Studies show that only 35% of private practitioners and 75% of government doctors can correctly diagnose TB in patients with typical symptoms. This diagnostic gap delays treatment initiation and worsens patient outcomes.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Challenges in TB Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
<p>India faces multiple challenges in TB diagnosis and treatment. These include frequent updates to guidelines, a shortage of trained healthcare professionals, and the high cost and limited availability of molecular tests. These factors contribute to delays in diagnosis and treatment, particularly in rural areas.</p>
<h3>Staffing Challenges</h3>
<p>The NTEP is struggling with staffing shortages, which makes it difficult to meet the growing demand for services. More trained personnel are needed to ensure that the TB program can operate effectively across the country.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>What Needs to be Done</h2>
<p>Ownership at all levels, from the community to the highest political echelons, is essential to achieve TB control. Local governments must take responsibility, as seen in the case of Idukki district in Kerala, where a collaboration with Kudumbashree helped achieve notable success in TB elimination.</p>
<h3>Advocacy and Political Leadership</h3>
<p>Political leadership plays a crucial role in ensuring that TB programs receive adequate resources and attention. Advocating for TB elimination and learning from successful local initiatives will help accelerate progress.</p>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although the goal of eliminating TB by 2025 seems increasingly difficult to achieve, India has made significant progress. The country's case notification rates are at an all-time high, and TB-related deaths have decreased by 24% compared to 2015. Lessons can be drawn from countries like Vietnam, which have successfully implemented active case finding and targeted interventions. India must consider restructuring its TB control programs and implement strategies based on local challenges and successes to make meaningful progress in the fight against TB.</p>
