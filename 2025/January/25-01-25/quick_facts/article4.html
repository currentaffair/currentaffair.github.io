<h1>Unused Worker Welfare Funds</h1>

<h2>Unused Cess Funds for Workers</h2>
<p>States have not utilized ₹70,744.16 crore of cess funds, which were collected for the welfare of building and other construction workers. These funds are part of the Building and Other Construction Workers Act (1996).</p>
<h2>Fund Collection and Allocation</h2>
<p>Since 2005, ₹1,17,507.22 crore has been collected as cess, but only ₹67,669.92 crore has been allocated to workers' welfare. Despite this, large portions of the funds remain unspent by State Welfare Boards.</p>
<h2>RTI Reply and Fund Transparency</h2>
<p>An RTI response from the Union Labour Ministry revealed that many State Welfare Boards have not spent the cess funds, which were intended for worker welfare. There is also a lack of data on the actual cost of construction projects, affecting transparency.</p>
<h2>State Spending on Worker Welfare</h2>
<p>States have allocated minimal funds for workers: 
        <ul>
<li>Maharashtra: ₹13,683.18 crore</li>
<li>Karnataka: ₹7,921.42 crore</li>
<li>Uttar Pradesh: ₹7,826.66 crore</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Post-COVID and Cess Evasion</h2>
<p>Concerns were raised about the lack of support for construction workers during the COVID-19 exodus. Trade union leaders allege that cess evasion by builders is widespread, with significant amounts of cess going uncollected.</p>
<h2>Implications of the Social Security Code</h2>
<p>The new Code on Social Security could potentially reduce cess collections and employer obligations, which might lead to fewer benefits for workers. Implementation issues in most states further worsen this situation, limiting the benefits of the Building and Other Construction Workers Act.</p>
