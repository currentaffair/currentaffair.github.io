<h2>Health Concerns and Court's Ruling</h2>
<p>The Bombay High Court ruled that the use of loudspeakers is not essential to any religion. The court emphasized that noise is a significant health hazard, thus necessitating the regulation of loudspeakers.</p>
<h2>Direction for Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Law enforcement agencies were directed to act promptly against violations of noise pollution. Religious institutions were urged to use sound systems with auto-decibel limits to control noise.</p>
<h2>Background and Petition</h2>
<p>The ruling followed a petition filed by housing associations in Kurla, Mumbai, citing police inaction regarding noise pollution caused by loudspeakers in masjids.</p>
<h2>Noise Pollution Concerns</h2>
<p>The petitioners argued that the use of loudspeakers for religious purposes violated the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.</p>
<h2>Impact on Public Peace</h2>
<p>The court emphasized Mumbai's cosmopolitan nature and stated that granting loudspeaker permissions could infringe on public peace and disturb the public order.</p>
<h2>Religious Rights and Public Interest</h2>
<p>The court ruled that denying loudspeaker permissions does not infringe on religious rights under Articles 19 (freedom of speech) and 25 (freedom of religion) of the Constitution. It was deemed necessary for public interest to maintain peace in the city.</p>
<h2>Citizens' Plight</h2>
<p>The court acknowledged that citizens suffer due to the use of loudspeakers and amplified sounds, placing the responsibility on the state and authorities to enforce the law effectively.</p>
