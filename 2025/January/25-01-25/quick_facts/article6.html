<h1>Rhodamine B Health Risks</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye commonly used in textiles, paper, leather, and scientific research for its fluorescent properties. However, recent studies have raised serious concerns about its health risks.</p>
<h2>Health Risks</h2>
<p>Research indicates that Rhodamine B can cause DNA damage, leading to mutations and potentially cancerous growths. Animal studies show tumors in organs such as the liver and bladder following prolonged exposure.</p>
<h2>Global Concerns</h2>
<h3>United States</h3>
<p>The FDA has long banned Rhodamine B in food products, and it reinforced the ban in January 2025 due to its carcinogenic risks, particularly in candies and baked goods.</p>
<h3>European Union</h3>
<p>The EU has classified Rhodamine B as a substance of very high concern, restricting its use in cosmetics and consumer goods.</p>
<h2>Indian Perspective</h2>
<h3>Tamil Nadu</h3>
<p>In February 2024, Tamil Nadu banned the production and sale of cotton candy after detecting Rhodamine B in samples to ensure public health.</p>
<h3>Karnataka</h3>
<p>In March 2024, Karnataka prohibited the use of Rhodamine B in street foods like “Gobi Manchurian” and cotton candy, with severe penalties for violators.</p>
<h3>Other States</h3>
<p>Puducherry and Himachal Pradesh followed Tamil Nadu's lead with similar bans on cotton candy.</p>
<h2>Expert Opinions</h2>
<h3>Mohammed Mithi (Oncologist)</h3>
<p>Rhodamine B, along with other synthetic dyes, may pose carcinogenic risks due to DNA damage in animal models, especially with long-term exposure. Vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are at higher risk.</p>
<h3>Abyramy Balasundaram (Dermatologist)</h3>
<p>While synthetic dyes may cause allergic reactions, long-term exposure could lead to chronic skin issues. Rhodamine B was banned in EU cosmetics in the 1990s due to its carcinogenic effects.</p>
<h2>India’s Food Safety Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Health expert Priyadarshini Chidambaram highlights the need for proactive research on food dye safety in India, recommending collaborations between FSSAI and academic institutions. Public education and strict enforcement are essential to mitigate health risks.</p>
