<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The ₹43,000 crore P-75I submarine project aims to acquire six advanced conventional submarines, focusing on indigenization and technological upgrades.</p>
<h2>Bid Details</h2>
<p>The bid from Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), Mumbai, and Germany’s TKMS (Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems) has cleared the technical evaluation. Meanwhile, the bid from Larsen &amp; Toubro and Navantia of Spain did not pass the technical evaluation.</p>
<h2>Evaluation Process</h2>
<p>Compliance checks for both bids were completed in June last year during the Field Evaluation Trials (FET). MDL-TKMS’s bid passed the technical evaluation, and commercial negotiations will now begin based on the submitted price.</p>
<h2>Price Revision Expected</h2>
<p>The project’s benchmarked price was set a decade ago. Due to technological advancements, inflation, and currency fluctuations, the final cost is expected to rise significantly.</p>
<h2>Indigenous Content Requirement</h2>
<p>The Request For Proposal (RFP) specifies that the first submarine must have 45% indigenous content, increasing to 60% for the sixth submarine.</p>
<h2>Key Selection Criterion</h2>
<p>A key factor in the selection is the Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) module, which enhances the endurance and stealth of the submarine.</p>
<h2>MDL-TKMS Offering</h2>
<p>The MDL-TKMS bid is based on the Class 214 submarine design, which is known for its operational success and proven AIP module.</p>
<h2>Navantia’s Offering</h2>
<p>Navantia has proposed a design based on the new S80 class, with the first submarine (S-81 ‘Isaac Peral’) launched in 2021.</p>
