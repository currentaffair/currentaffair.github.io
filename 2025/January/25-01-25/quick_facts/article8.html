<h1>Halal Certification Controversy</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Solicitor General opposed halal certification for non-meat products like cement, iron bars, and wheat flour in response to a petition in the Supreme Court. The practice is alleged to harm businesses that do not adhere to halal standards and create unfair competition.</p>
<h2>Allegations</h2>
<p>Companies have been accused of issuing forged halal certificates, exploiting religious sentiments for sales, and causing social animosity by violating public trust.</p>
<h2>What is Halal?</h2>
<p>Halal, an Arabic word meaning "permissible," refers to food and products that meet Islamic law standards. Halal certification ensures that products are prepared according to these laws and remain unadulterated.</p>
<h2>Halal Certification in India</h2>
<p>India lacks a national halal certification system but is working on streamlining halal certification for meat products through the i-CAS (Indian Conformity Assessment Scheme). This scheme ensures that meat products are certified for export if produced, processed, and packaged in certified facilities.</p>
<h2>Role of Solicitor General</h2>
<p>The Solicitor General is the second most senior law officer in the government, ranking just below the Attorney General.</p>
