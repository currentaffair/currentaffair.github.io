<h2>Poaching Incident in Similipal</h2>
<p>The Odisha Forest Department arrested four poachers from the Lodha tribe for illegally hunting a rare melanistic tiger in Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR).</p>
<h2>Melanistic Tiger Facts</h2>
<p>Melanism is a genetic condition where animals produce more melanin, leading to darker skin or fur. The melanistic tiger in STR is a sub-adult with a rare genetic trait. It is part of a group of only 20 such tigers worldwide.</p>
<h2>Melanistic Tigers in STR</h2>
<p>The STR is home to 27 tigers, including 13 adult pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have higher melanin levels, creating a unique black and yellow striped pattern.</p>
<h2>Other Tiger Color Variations</h2>
<p>Tigers can be orange with black or brown stripes (Royal Bengal Tiger), white due to leucism, or golden from a recessive gene called "wideband," reducing melanin production.</p>
<h2>About Similipal Tiger Reserve</h2>
<p>Located in the Deccan Peninsula Biogeographic Zone, Similipal is known for its rich vegetation and diverse fauna. It has been a Global Network of Biospheres site since 2009.</p>
