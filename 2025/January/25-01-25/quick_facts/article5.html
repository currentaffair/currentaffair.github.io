<h1>Debate on Poverty Decline</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Poverty was historically defined by calorie consumption, later updated with National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data. Discrepancies between NSSO and National Accounts have led to concerns about data accuracy. Methodological shifts have complicated comparisons over time.</p>
<h2>Debate on Poverty Decline</h2>
<h3>P.C. Mohanan’s View</h3>
<p>P.C. Mohanan questions the drastic decline in poverty, pointing to varying poverty lines and data inconsistencies.</p>
<h3>N.R. Bhanumurthy’s View</h3>
<p>N.R. Bhanumurthy acknowledges poverty reduction but attributes it to high GDP growth, welfare programs, and improved public systems, suggesting a further decline in poverty.</p>
<h2>Concerns with Data</h2>
<h3>Household Consumption Data (HCES)</h3>
<p>Data inconsistencies arise from varying recall periods for different categories, such as 7 days for food and 30 days for others. The new NSSO methodology improves data accuracy but presents challenges when compared with older poverty lines.</p>
<h3>Need for New Poverty Line</h3>
<p>Experts stress the need for a new, universally agreed poverty line based on current methodologies.</p>
<h2>Rural vs Urban Poverty</h2>
<h3>P.C. Mohanan’s View</h3>
<p>The rural-urban consumption gap is narrowing, with rural areas improving and urban consumption diversifying.</p>
<h3>N.R. Bhanumurthy’s View</h3>
<p>He calls for clearer definitions of rural and urban areas to refine poverty estimation.</p>
<h2>Upward Revision of Poverty Line</h2>
<h3>P.C. Mohanan’s View</h3>
<p>He cites a study estimating 25% poverty using Rangarajan’s methodology but doubts a straightforward update to the poverty line.</p>
<h3>N.R. Bhanumurthy’s View</h3>
<p>He disagrees with the 25% estimate, citing UNDP’s estimate of 12.9% poverty in India in 2019 and emphasizing the need for a consistent methodology for poverty line estimation.</p>
<h2>Multidimensional Poverty Index Criticisms</h2>
<h3>UNDP’s Methodology</h3>
<p>The UNDP's methodology is global, leaving countries to adapt it. India’s index includes 12 indicators, such as bank accounts and maternal health, which is seen positively by N.R. Bhanumurthy.</p>
<h3>P.C. Mohanan’s Critique</h3>
<p>He critiques the index for being static, where once a household achieves basic services, it is classified as non-deprived, potentially underestimating ongoing vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both experts agree that while poverty has reduced, the methodologies for measuring it are inconsistent. There is a need for clearer definitions and better data to ensure accurate poverty assessments.</p>
