<h2>Why in News?</h2>
<p>The Prime Minister of India greeted Manipur, Tripura, and Meghalaya on their Statehood Day, which is celebrated on January 21st each year.</p>
<h2>Historical Context of Statehood</h2>
<h3>Manipur</h3>
<p>Manipur was an independent princely state before 1947. It merged with India after the Maharaja signed the 'Instrument of Accession'. It became a Union Territory in 1956 and gained full statehood in 1972.</p>
<h3>Tripura</h3>
<p>Tripura, also a princely state, merged with India in 1949. It became a Union Territory in 1956 and achieved full statehood in 1972.</p>
<h3>Meghalaya</h3>
<p>Meghalaya's demand for autonomy led to its creation as an autonomous state within Assam in 1969. It became a full state in 1972 after the NEA-(R) Act was enacted.</p>
<h2>North-Eastern Areas (Re-organization) Act, 1971</h2>
<p>The NEA-(R) Act granted full statehood to Manipur, Tripura, and Meghalaya, and established other North-Eastern states as Union Territories. The Act ensured proper representation in the legislature and the establishment of a common High Court (Gauhati High Court).</p>
