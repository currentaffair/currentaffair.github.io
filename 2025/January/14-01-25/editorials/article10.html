        Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023: A Critical Analysis
    </header>

    <section>
        <img src="data-protection.jpg" alt="Data Protection" />

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In August 2024, India marked six years since the K.S. Puttaswamy judgment reaffirmed privacy as a fundamental right. This milestone prompted the Internet Freedom Foundation to host the annual “Privacy Supreme” event. Rather than a celebration, the event reflected on the unfulfilled promise of privacy, with social activist Nikhil Dey sharing alarming accounts from Ajmer, Rajasthan. He highlighted how Aadhaar, initially lauded for its efficiency, has excluded vulnerable residents from essential services like pensions and rations. These troubling realities should remain central to tech policy discussions, especially regarding the Draft Digital Data Protection Rules, 2025.
        </p>

        <h2>Executive Overreach and Lack of Transparency</h2>
        <p>
            Rulemaking serves to implement legislation, ensuring that laws passed by Parliament are enforceable while allowing for administrative flexibility. However, the draft Data Protection Rules raise concerns regarding executive overreach and the lack of transparency in their formulation. The vagueness of certain provisions leads to uncertainty in their application, undermining the objective of protecting digital personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023</h2>
        <p>
            The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, serves as the parent law for the draft rules. It was passed hastily through Parliament and has raised significant concerns regarding its democratic legitimacy. Critics argue that the Act’s provisions promote a policy of "total state control," limiting individual freedoms under the guise of digital protection. Key provisions, such as those related to "prescribed" rules, are intentionally vague, giving the government significant discretion over the application of the law.
        </p>

        <h2>Delay in Implementation and Lack of Public Participation</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the swift passage of the Act in August 2023, its implementation remains delayed. The unveiling of the Draft Rules for consultation, more than a year later, raised further concerns about their true accessibility to the public. With comments only allowed through the MyGov platform and submissions treated as fiduciary, the consultation process has been criticized for its lack of openness and inclusivity. This process has been described as more of a "corporate consultation" than a truly public one.
        </p>

        <h2>Substantive Issues with the Data Protection Rules</h2>
        <p>
            The draft rules are deeply problematic, relying on vague language and granting excessive discretion to government authorities. Key issues include unclear standards for consent notices, ambiguity in data disclosure requirements, and the lack of independent oversight. These issues point to a broader structural flaw in the Data Protection framework, where the government holds significant control over citizens' personal data without proper checks and balances.
        </p>

        <h2>Rule 3: Consent Notices</h2>
        <p class="highlight">
            Rule 3 mandates that consent notices be written in “clear and plain language.” However, this fails to define the terms clearly, making it difficult to apply the rule uniformly across India’s diverse linguistic landscape. The absence of specific standards for these notices could lead to oversimplified or generic disclosures, omitting critical information that users need to make informed decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Ambiguity in Data Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
            The draft rules mandate an "itemized description" of data but leave significant gaps in clarity. It is unclear whether the disclosure applies to categories of data such as financial or health data, or to specific data points like account numbers or even metadata. Furthermore, there are no clear guidelines for data breach notifications, leaving individuals at risk in urgent situations. The absence of a standard-setting regulatory authority only exacerbates these concerns.
        </p>

        <h2>No Independence for the Data Protection Board</h2>
        <p>
            The lack of an independent regulatory body further undermines the effectiveness of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act. The Data Protection Board (DPB), responsible for adjudicating data breaches, is not independent. Its chairperson is selected by a committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary, raising concerns about political influence in the appointment process.
        </p>

        <h2>Limitations of the DPB After Formation</h2>
        <p>
            Even after its formation, the DPB's authority is limited. Its power is restricted to adjudicating data breaches, and its members’ service conditions tie them to central government employment. This directly contradicts long-standing recommendations for independent data protection oversight and casts doubt on the DPB’s ability to serve as a neutral body for protecting citizens' rights.
        </p>

        <h2>Effectiveness of a Subservient DPB</h2>
        <p class="important">
            The DPB’s subservience to the government raises questions about its ability to effectively enforce data protection laws. Rule 5, which exempts data processing for subsidies from consent requirements, highlights the challenge of holding powerful government agencies accountable. Without robust enforcement, it is unlikely that citizens’ rights, especially in vulnerable sectors like rations and subsidies, will be adequately protected.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="conclusion">
            The absence of clear limitations and safeguards in Rule 22, which grants the government the power to requisition information, reflects broader concerns about the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. The lack of independent oversight, vague provisions, and limited public participation all point to a troubling future for digital privacy in India. As activist Nikhil Dey aptly pointed out, the government's approach to data protection may be likened to the famous conversation between Alice and Humpty Dumpty in *Through the Looking-Glass* — where the meaning of words is distorted to suit those in power.
