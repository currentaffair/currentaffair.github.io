        <img src="path_to_image.jpg" alt="Trumpian Worldview">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dissecting the psychology of the next U.S. President, Donald Trump, reveals a bold and disinhibited leader whose unique speaking style and deal-making tactics have shaped his political persona. Trump's "America First" rhetoric appeals to populist sentiments, positioning him as the champion of "common people" against an establishment that he portrays as out of touch with the realities of everyday citizens.</p>

        <h2>Trump's "America First" Doctrine</h2>
        <p>Trump's approach to the international order is primarily shaped by his "America First" doctrine, where American sovereignty is placed above global governance. He challenges multilateralism and dismisses international institutions like the United Nations and NATO, viewing them as tools that disproportionately benefit other nations at the expense of the U.S.</p>
        <p>He prefers bilateral agreements, as seen in his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and opposition to multilateral trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump's stance places an emphasis on transactional diplomacy, often prioritizing immediate practical outcomes over long-term cooperative frameworks.</p>

        <h3>The Trumpian Worldview</h3>
        <p>In Trump's worldview, political strategy is centered around the "bully pulpit" and strong personal branding. His unconventional approach to deal-making, characterized by win-or-lose outcomes, prioritizes assertiveness and risk-taking over traditional diplomatic methods. Trump's policies often reflect this transactional mindset, emphasizing results over theoretical constructs.</p>

        <h2>Global Impact of Trump's Policies</h2>
        <h3>Impact on Trade and Geopolitics</h3>
        <p>Trump's "America First" policies are likely to lead to a rise in protectionism, escalating tariffs, and economic uncertainty. The competition with China, framed as both an economic and ideological adversary, is expected to intensify, leading to significant shifts in global geopolitics. Trump's stance will affect global markets, increasing polarization in international politics.</p>

        <h3>American Isolationism</h3>
        <p>The Trump administration's stance on isolationism, especially regarding military intervention abroad, may embolden other global powers, such as China and Russia, to expand their influence. This could lead to disruptions in various regions, reshaping the balance of global power.</p>

        <h2>U.S.-India Relations Under Trump</h2>
        <h3>Strategic Outlook</h3>
        <p>Despite challenges, India and the U.S. have seen steady growth in relations over the years, particularly under Prime Minister Modi's leadership. A second Trump presidency is expected to further solidify this partnership, with a shared interest in countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
        
        <h3>Strengthening Alliances</h3>
        <p>Strategic alliances, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) involving India, the U.S., Japan, and Australia, are likely to strengthen in response to China's growing influence. However, India must balance this with its desire for strategic autonomy, ensuring that its own priorities are not overshadowed by U.S. interests.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The second Trump presidency is set to disrupt established geopolitical patterns, leading to a more fragmented, polarized world order. Trump's isolationist policies and transactional approach will reshape the global landscape, with uncertain implications for international cooperation and stability.</p>
