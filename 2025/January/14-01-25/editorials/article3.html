<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules of 2025, released by the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), marks a significant step toward operationalizing the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. However, these rules have stirred concerns over executive overreach, lack of independence in the regulatory framework, and vague provisions, all of which pose serious implications for privacy and data protection in India.</p>
<h3>Executive Overreach and Centralized Control</h3>
<p>The draft rules empower the government with unchecked discretion over the digital ecosystem, granting wide-ranging powers to regulate businesses and data handling practices. Notably, the absence of transparent compliance standards allows the government to issue arbitrary directives without clear timelines or rules.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The rules provide the government the authority to decide compliance mechanisms, without clear standards, making businesses susceptible to unpredictable regulatory actions.</p>
</div>
<h3>Lack of Independence for the Data Protection Board (DPB)</h3>
<p>The Data Protection Board (DPB), crucial for enforcing data protection laws, lacks functional autonomy. The selection process for board members is controlled by the executive, raising concerns over political influence and undermining the board’s ability to act impartially.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Key Issue:</strong> The DPB’s lack of independence compromises accountability, particularly in matters involving sensitive government data, such as Aadhaar.</p>
</div>
<h3>Vague Provisions and Lack of Transparency</h3>
<p>The draft rules are criticized for vague provisions that enable the government to interpret regulations at its discretion. For instance, Rule 22 grants the government power to requisition data without procedural safeguards, raising fears of misuse.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The MyGov platform limits public participation in consultations, undermining transparency and accountability in policy-making.</p>
</div>
<h3>Exemptions for Government Data Processing</h3>
<p>Under Rule 5, the government is exempted from consent requirements for processing data related to welfare programs or subsidies. This exemption raises concerns about the state’s ability to misuse personal data without accountability.</p>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Concern:</strong> Government exemptions undermine citizen privacy rights, particularly in the case of Aadhaar-linked welfare programs.</p>
</div>
<h3>Procedural Integrity and State Surveillance Risks</h3>
<p>The absence of safeguards against arbitrary government data requisitions exposes citizens to potential state surveillance. This is akin to a "digital leash," where the state can control individuals through their digital activities.</p>
<h3>Historical Context: K.S. Puttaswamy Judgment</h3>
<p>The K.S. Puttaswamy judgment of 2017 reaffirmed privacy as a fundamental right. However, the draft DPDP rules contradict the spirit of this ruling by granting excessive powers to the state, risking mass surveillance and erosion of individual freedoms.</p>
<h3>Comparison with Global Standards</h3>
<p>In contrast to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which provides strong regulatory independence, India’s DPDP rules grant excessive discretionary powers to the government and lack transparency, revealing a more authoritarian approach.</p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>To address these issues, the Indian government must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establish an Independent Data Protection Authority:</strong> This body should oversee compliance and adjudicate disputes with autonomy.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Transparent Rulemaking:</strong> Public consultations should be inclusive, and submissions should be made public to allow for meaningful counter-comments.&lt;/
</li></ul></section></body></html>
