        Groundwater Usage in India: A Critical Overview
    </header>

    <section>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1500x500" alt="Groundwater Overview">

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>India’s agricultural sector has long been driven by the need for irrigation, especially for water-intensive crops like paddy. However, this demand for water comes at a significant cost to the country's groundwater resources. As India’s population continues to grow, so does the demand for water, exacerbating the already precarious state of groundwater levels. The situation is further compounded by various factors such as erratic rainfall patterns, industrial pollution, and over-reliance on groundwater for irrigation. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the current groundwater situation in India, examining the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to the crisis.</p>

        <h2>Current Scenario of Groundwater Usage in India</h2>
        <p>India is the largest extractor of groundwater globally, accounting for nearly 25% of the world's total usage. In 2023, India extracted 241.34 bcm of groundwater, with over 90% of it used for irrigation purposes. With over 736 districts categorized as over-exploited, the situation has reached a critical point, particularly in agricultural states like Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Groundwater usage for irrigation has surged from 38% in 2016 to 52% in 2024, further exacerbating water scarcity.</p>

        <h3>Groundwater Extraction and Availability</h3>
        <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
            <tr>
                <th style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Year</th>
                <th style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Total Groundwater Extraction (bcm)</th>

        <h3>Regulatory Framework</h3>
        <p>The Indian government has established several regulations to address groundwater depletion, such as the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA), which was formed in 1997. Various state-level regulations have also been put in place to regulate groundwater extraction, and initiatives like the Atal Bhujal Yojana aim to encourage sustainable practices. However, the need for more stringent enforcement and scaling up of these efforts is crucial, especially in over-exploited regions.</p>

        <h2>Key Factors Responsible for Groundwater Shortage and Contamination</h2>

        <h3>Water-Intensive Agriculture Practices</h3>
        <p>India’s agricultural sector, particularly the cultivation of paddy and sugarcane, places immense pressure on groundwater resources. Subsidies and free electricity in states like Punjab and Haryana encourage excessive pumping, leading to unsustainable extraction levels. As a result, these areas are facing significant groundwater depletion, with some regions experiencing annual water deficits of up to 14 billion cubic meters.</p>

        <h3>Climate Change and Erratic Rainfall</h3>
        <p>Climate change has disrupted seasonal rainfall patterns, reducing the recharge rates of groundwater. Erratic monsoons and increased evaporation due to higher temperatures have led to severe water shortages, particularly in regions like Tamil Nadu, where reliance on groundwater has increased due to poor rainfall.</p>

        <h3>Industrial Pollution</h3>
        <p>Industrial discharges and untreated wastewater pose significant threats to groundwater quality. In regions like Kanpur, the discharge from tanneries has led to widespread contamination of groundwater with toxic metals like chromium, mercury, and lead, resulting in severe health risks for local communities.</p>

        <h2>Government Initiatives for Groundwater Management</h2>
        <p>The government has launched multiple initiatives such as Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) to improve water conservation practices. Additionally, the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) aims to enhance water-use efficiency in agriculture. These initiatives are critical to mitigating groundwater stress and promoting sustainable usage across the country.</p>

        <h2>Effective Measures for Groundwater Management</h2>
        <h3>Promoting Water-Efficient Agriculture</h3>
        <p>To reduce dependency on groundwater, India must adopt water-efficient agricultural practices such as drip irrigation and micro-irrigation. These methods significantly reduce water usage while increasing crop yield, thus alleviating the strain
