    Amendment to Rule 93(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules: A Threat to Electoral Transparency
</header>

<img alt="Election Transparency Image" src="image-placeholder.jpg"/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2024, an incident came to light where presiding officer Anil Masih was caught manipulating votes during the Chandigarh mayor elections. This event underscored the need for transparency in the electoral process. Ironically, the Central government amended Rule 93(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, restricting public access to election-related records.</p>
<h3>Amendment Following High Court Direction</h3>
<p>The amendment to Rule 93(2) was made shortly after the Punjab and Haryana High Court directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) to provide access to information under Rule 93(2), including documents like Form 17C and CCTV footage from Haryana Assembly elections. The government’s move came at a time when public access to such documents was being actively sought by petitioners.</p>
<h2>Rule 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules</h2>
<p>Rule 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules lays out the framework for citizens to access election-related documents. Initially, Rule 93(2) allowed public access to all papers related to elections, except those specifically exempted under Rule 93(1). The new amendment limits public access to only specific papers as outlined in the rules, significantly narrowing citizens’ right to information.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<strong>Important Change:</strong> The new amendment limits the types of election-related records open to public inspection, including key documents such as Form 17C, CCTV footage, and video recordings.

<h2>Delays and Doubts about the ECI's Role</h2>
<h3>The Election Commission’s Disconcerting Role</h3>
<p>The Election Commission of India (ECI) plays a crucial role in ensuring the transparency and integrity of elections. However, its opposition to sharing documents, such as Form 17C, raises concerns about its commitment to transparency. The ECI's reluctance is surprising, considering that transparency in elections is vital for maintaining public trust.</p>
<h3>ECI’s Handling of Voter Turnout Figures</h3>
<p>During the 2024 general elections, the ECI did not release voter turnout figures in absolute numbers after the initial phases of voting. There were also large discrepancies in voter turnout figures that prompted political parties to seek access to Form 17C to investigate the numbers. The refusal to release this crucial data only fueled public suspicion about the integrity of the election process.</p>
<h2>Form 17C and Its Significance</h2>
<p>Form 17C provides essential information about voter turnout and the number of votes recorded in the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Part I of Form 17C is filled out by the presiding officer and submitted to the Returning Officer after voting ends, while Part II is filled out during the counting process. The form provides a snapshot of voter turnout and vote counts, allowing for a verification of whether the numbers match up.</p>
<div class="important">
<strong>Significance of Form 17C:</strong> This form helps verify whether voter turnout matches the votes recorded, thus serving as a key safeguard against fraud and discrepancies.

<h3>Political Parties Demand for Transparency</h3>
<p>Following the 2024 elections, various political parties, including BJP allies, sought copies of Form 17C to verify the discrepancies in voter turnout. However, requests were stonewalled by the ECI, leading to further suspicions and calls for greater transparency.</p>
<h3>Concerns in Haryana and Maharashtra Elections</h3>
<p>Similar issues arose during the Haryana and Maharashtra Assembly elections, where political parties and candidates demanded access to Form 17C. Despite repeated requests, these were denied by the ECI, leading to further mistrust in the process.</p>
<h2>Refusal to Disclose Information</h2>
<p>The ECI’s refusal to disclose election-related documents, particularly Form 17C, highlights a troubling trend. Even after multiple requests, including those from political parties, the ECI failed to comply, citing concerns over the potential misuse of the data. However, these concerns appear unfounded given that Form 17C is already distributed to polling agents and is not prohibited from being shared further.</p>
<h3>ECI’s Opposition to Proactive Disclosure of Form 17C</h3>
<p>When the matter of proactive disclosure of Form 17C reached the Supreme Court, the ECI argued against its release. The Commission claimed that unrestricted disclosure could lead to data manipulation. However, this argument overlooks the fact that Form 17C is already in the hands of polling agents, with no prohibition on further distribution.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<strong>Transparency Concerns:</strong> The ECI’s reluctance to disclose Form 17C raises questions about the true commitment to transparency in the election process.
    </div>
<h3>Delayed Release of Statistical Reports</h3>
<p>In December 2024, the ECI released a set of 42 statistical reports that did not include Form 17C data. These reports were labeled as a “Treasure Trove for stakeholders” but lacked the key data needed to resolve questions about discrepancies in voter turnout. The absence of Form 17C data further exacerbated concerns about the integrity of the election process.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div class="conclusion">
        Transparency is crucial to maintaining public trust in the electoral process. The new amendment restricting access to election-related records undermines this transparency and potentially opens the door to corruption. As the matter moves to the Supreme Court, it is imperative that the ECI and the ruling party realize that such amendments have no place in a democratic system and must be withdrawn.
