    Challenges and Developments Related with Denotified Tribes
</header>

<section>
    <img src="title-image.jpg" alt="Denotified Tribes Image" />

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Denotified Tribes (DNTs), Nomadic Tribes (NTs), and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (SNTs) in India face numerous challenges, including the denial of caste certificates in most states. Despite the Indian Government launching the Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNTs (SEED) for their upliftment, various other issues have led to growing discontent among these communities.
    </p>

    <h2>Major Challenges Faced by DNTs, NTs, and SNTs</h2>
    <h3>Historical Injustice</h3>
    <p class="highlight">
        These tribes were labeled criminal tribes under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871 during British rule, stigmatizing them for generations. Despite being denotified in 1952, the stigma persists, impacting their social and economic inclusion. Historically, Nomadic Tribes and De-notified Tribes never had access to private land or home ownership.
    </p>

    <h3>Unclassified Communities</h3>
    <p>
        The Idate Commission (2017) identified a total of 1,526 DNT, NT, and SNT communities. However, 269 communities are still unclassified under the categories of either SC, ST, or OBC. Similarly, many individuals from these communities are unable to obtain caste certificates in 29 states, limiting their access to welfare schemes.
    </p>
    <p class="important">
        Estimates suggest a population of over 25 crore individuals, yet many lack basic identity recognition.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation Gaps</h3>
    <p>
        Recommendations of the Idate Commission, including a permanent commission and caste-census inclusion, remain unaddressed. The SEED scheme has seen limited success due to delays and lack of outreach. Overlapping benefits with SC/ST/OBC schemes lead to difficulties in beneficiary identification.
    </p>

    <h3>Lack of Representation</h3>
    <p>
        Leadership positions remain scarce for DNT communities, with no full-time chairperson in the Union government's Development and Welfare Board for DNTs, SNTs, and NTs (DWBDNC).
    </p>

    <h2>Idate Commission, 2014</h2>
    <p>
        The Idate Commission was established in 2014 under the leadership of Bhiku Ramji Idate to compile a statewide catalogue of Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). Its mandate was to recognize those excluded from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) categories and recommend welfare measures for their well-being.
    </p>

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a permanent commission with legal standing for the DNTs, SNTs, and NTs.</li>
        <li>Assign individuals not identified in the SCs/STs/OBCs list to the OBC category.</li>
        <li>Enhance legal and constitutional safeguards by incorporating a third schedule into the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.</li>
        <li>Form a distinct department to address the welfare of these communities in states with significant populations.</li>
        <li>Undertake a thorough survey of DNT families to determine their estimated numbers and distribution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who are DNTs, NTs, and SNTs?</h2>
    <p>
        The term De-notified Tribes refers to communities that were once classified under the Criminal Tribes Acts, 1871, which were implemented by the British Government. The Acts were abolished by the Government of India in 1952, leading to the De-Notification of these communities.
    </p>

    <h3>Distribution</h3>
    <p>
        DNTs encompass a wide range of communities, each with unique cultural practices, languages, and socio-economic conditions. Communities include the Kanjar, Nat, Pardhi, and Sapera. South Asia is estimated to have the largest nomadic population in the world, with approximately 10% of Indiaâ€™s population comprising NTs, SNTs, and DNTs.
    </p>

    <h2>SEED Scheme</h2>
    <p>
        The Scheme for Economic Empowerment Denotified, Nomadic, Semi-Nomadic communities (SEED) was launched in February 2022. It aims to provide competitive exam coaching for students, offer health insurance to families, and uplift communities through livelihood initiatives and housing construction under the PM Awas Yojana.
    </p>

    <h2>India's Efforts for DNTs, NTs, and SNTs</h2>
    <p>
        Various schemes like the Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarships for DNT students, and the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme of Construction of Hostels for DNT Boys and Girls, have been initiated for the welfare of DNT students.
    </p>

    <h2>Way Forward</h2>
    <p>
        To address the challenges faced by DNTs, NTs, and SNTs, it is essential to expedite the classification process within the SC/ST/OBC frameworks, improve the outreach of the SEED scheme, and conduct a caste-based census to capture their socio-economic conditions.
    </p>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The challenges faced by Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes in India are deeply rooted in historical stigmatization and present systemic barriers to their socio-economic inclusion. Strengthening policy frameworks and ensuring proper implementation of welfare schemes will be crucial for their upliftment.
