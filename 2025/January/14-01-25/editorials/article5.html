<header>Challenges and Developments Related with Denotified Tribes</header>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Denotified Tribes (DNTs), Nomadic Tribes (NTs), and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (SNTs) in India face numerous challenges, including denial of caste certificates in most states. Despite the Indian Government launching the Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNTs (SEED) for their upliftment, various other issues have led to growing discontent among these communities.</p>

    <h2>Major Challenges Faced by DNTs, NTs, and SNTs</h2>
    <h3>Historical Injustice</h3>
    <p>These tribes were labeled criminal tribes under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871 during British rule, stigmatizing them for generations. Despite being denotified in 1952, the stigma persists, impacting their social and economic inclusion. Historically, Nomadic Tribes and De-notified Tribes never had access to private land or home ownership.</p>

    <h3>Unclassified Communities</h3>
    <p>The Idate Commission (2017) identified a total of 1,526 DNT, NT, and SNT communities. Out of these, 269 communities are still unclassified under SC, ST, or OBC categories. This classification issue limits their access to welfare schemes in 29 states, even though their population is estimated to be over 25 crore.</p>

    <h3>Implementation Gaps</h3>
    <p>Recommendations of the Idate Commission, including the creation of a permanent commission and caste-census inclusion, remain unaddressed. The SEED scheme has seen limited success due to delays, lack of outreach, and overlapping benefits with SC/ST/OBC schemes, making beneficiary identification difficult.</p>

    <h3>Lack of Representation</h3>
    <p>Leadership positions for DNT communities remain scarce, with no full-time chairperson in the Union government’s Development and Welfare Board for DNTs, SNTs, and NTs (DWBDNC).</p>

    <h2>Idate Commission, 2014</h2>
    <p>The Idate Commission was established to compile a statewide catalog of Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). The commission aimed to recognize those excluded from SC, ST, and OBC categories and recommend welfare measures for their well-being.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a permanent commission with legal standing for the DNTs, SNTs, and NTs.</li>
        <li>Assign individuals not identified in SCs/STs/OBCs to the OBC category.</li>
        <li>Enhance legal safeguards by incorporating a third schedule into the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.</li>
        <li>Form a distinct department to address welfare in states with significant populations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who are DNTs, NTs, and SNTs?</h2>
    <p>The term De-notified Tribes refers to communities that were once classified under the Criminal Tribes Acts, 1871. Though these Acts were repealed in 1952, the stigma continues to affect these communities. Nomadic and semi-nomadic communities are defined as those who migrate from one place to another rather than settle in one location.</p>

    <h3>Distribution</h3>
    <p>DNTs encompass a range of communities such as the Kanjar, Nat, Pardhi, and Sapera. South Asia is estimated to have the largest nomadic population in the world, with approximately 10% of India's population comprising NTs, SNTs, and DNTs.</p>

    <h2>What is SEED?</h2>
    <p>The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNTs, launched in February 2022, aims to provide free coaching for competitive exams, health insurance, livelihood support, and housing construction. The scheme's goal is to uplift the communities and ensure access to essential services.</p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rs. 200 crore allocated for five years, starting in 2021-22.</li>
        <li>Health insurance under PM Jan Arogya Yojana.</li>
        <li>Livelihood support via National and State Rural Livelihood Missions (NRLM and SRLM).</li>
        <li>Financial support for housing under PM Awas Yojana.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>India's Efforts for DNTs, NTs, and SNTs</h2>
    <p>India has launched several initiatives such as Dr. Ambedkar’s scholarships, Nanaji Deshmukh schemes for hostel construction, and various centrally sponsored schemes for the welfare of DNT students.</p>

    <h2>Way Forward</h2>
    <h3>Policy Implementation</h3>
    <p>Efforts must be made to expedite the classification process for DNT communities within SC/ST/OBC frameworks. Policies should also be streamlined to ensure that caste certificates are issued to these communities.</p>

    <h3>Strengthening SEED Scheme</h3>
    <p>Improving outreach through active participation of NGOs and awareness campaigns is crucial to ensuring that all eligible families can access education, housing, and livelihood support.</p>

    <h3>Identity and Representation</h3>
    <p>Conducting a caste-based census will help capture the true socio-economic condition of these communities and enable better policy making and representation.</p>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes face significant challenges in India. Addressing issues like historical stigma, lack of recognition, and limited representation will be essential for the inclusion and empowerment of these communities. Continued efforts by the government, along with proactive community engagement, are necessary for sustained progress.</p>
