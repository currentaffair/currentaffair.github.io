<p>The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the draft rules for the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP Act), 2023 after 16 months. The rules are open for public feedback until mid-February and focus on the implementation framework of India’s first data privacy law.</p>
<h2>Key Concerns and Criticisms</h2>
<p>Critics, including civil society, have expressed concerns regarding the absence of a specialized regulator, insufficient protection against government data access, and the excessive delegation of regulatory functions to the government.</p>
<h2>Shortcomings in the Draft Rules</h2>
<p>The rules are vague, offering general guidance on mechanisms such as notice and consent for data collection, breach notifications, and parental consent for children’s data, but lack clarity on practical implementation.</p>
<h2>User Rights and Data Protection</h2>
<p>The DPDP Act grants users the right to access, correct, and erase their data, but the rules do not provide clear processes for exercising these rights. The rules also fail to address how businesses and data processors will handle erasure requests, especially concerning third-party content.</p>
<h2>Protecting Children’s Data</h2>
<p>The DPDP Act mandates parental consent for processing children’s data, but the draft rules lack clarity on how businesses should identify children and verify parental consent, leaving many operational questions unanswered.</p>
<h2>Overall Evaluation</h2>
<p>Despite a long drafting period, the rules are criticized for being incomplete and lacking operational clarity. Expert consultation and refinement are necessary before finalizing the rules.</p>
<h2>Call to Action</h2>
<p>The government must consult experts, address privacy concerns, and refine the rules to ensure clear guidelines for businesses and data processors.</p>
