<h2>Cultural and Astronomical Significance</h2>
<p>The transition of the Sun into the Capricorn zodiac (Makara) is celebrated during these festivals. Rituals include bathing, giving charity, offering Naivedhya (food) to Lord Surya, and breaking fast. Sacred rivers like Ganga and Yamuna are significant in the rituals.</p>
<h2>Regional Celebrations</h2>

Punjab celebrates Lohri with bonfires, folk songs, and offerings to the fire. In Bihar, Khichdi is celebrated with special dishes, and in Rajasthan and Gujarat, kite flying is a key activity.</p>
