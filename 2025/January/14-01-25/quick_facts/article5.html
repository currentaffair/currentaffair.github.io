<p>The Prime Minister inaugurated the Z-Morh tunnel to improve all-weather connectivity between Ladakh and Kashmir. This tunnel is located at 8,650 feet in Ganderbal, Kashmir, and bypasses avalanche-prone zones on the Srinagar-Leh highway.</p>
<h2>Location and Project Details</h2>
<p>The 6.5 km tunnel is built under the Thajiwas glacier and has been renamed Sonamarg Tunnel. It was constructed with an investment of Rs 2,400 crore, starting in 2015 under BRO and later developed by the NHIDCL.</p>
<h2>Strategic Importance</h2>
<p>In conjunction with the Zojila tunnel, the Z-Morh tunnel reduces the travel distance by 6 km between Srinagar and Ladakh, ensuring year-round connectivity for both military and civilian needs.</p>
<h2>Zojila Tunnel</h2>
<p>The Zoji La tunnel, at 14.15 km, is Asia’s longest bi-directional tunnel and ensures all-weather access between Srinagar, Kargil, and Leh.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Z-Morh tunnel plays a crucial role in improving road access and strategic connectivity to Ladakh, enhancing the region’s accessibility and safety.</p>
