<h1>Indian Companies and Data Localisation</h1>
<img alt="Data Localisation in India" src="data-localisation-india.jpg"/>
<p>Indian companies are capitalising on policy changes to localise data storage and telecom equipment production. Firms are increasingly focusing on manufacturing networking equipment and establishing data storage solutions within India.</p>
<h2>Relevance &amp; Key Players</h2>
<p>GS 2 (Governance) <br/> Key players: CloudPhotonix and DigiBoxx.</p>
<h2>Data Localisation and Regulation</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 supports future data localisation in certain sectors.</li>
<li>The Reserve Bank of India mandates local storage of payment data.</li>
<li>Privacy concerns and regulatory compliance are driving the demand for local storage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optical Transceiver Market Growth</h2>
<p>The global optical transceiver market is projected to reach $47.64 billion by 2035, driven by increased demand for networking and telecom equipment. Local production of transceivers is gaining momentum due to geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reducing reliance on foreign, especially Chinese, technology.</li>
<li>CloudPhotonix targets indigenous networking components crucial for telecom networks and data centres.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost and Security Considerations</h2>
<p>Local data storage options like DigiBoxx may be more expensive but are gaining traction due to the need for compliance with regulations and rising data privacy concerns.</p>
<h2>Industry Support</h2>
<p>The Union Secretary for Electronics and Information Technology, S. Krishnan, has welcomed the localisation efforts, which align with national interests and commercial viability.</p>
