<h1>ISRO's SPaDeX Mission: Satellite Docking</h1>
<img alt="ISRO's SPaDeX Mission" src="spadex-mission.jpg"/>
<p>ISRO is attempting to dock two satellites (SDX01 – Chaser, SDX02 – Target) in space as part of the SPaDeX mission, demonstrating spacecraft rendezvous, docking, and undocking technologies.</p>
<h2>Relevance &amp; Launch Details</h2>
<p>GS 3 (Space) <br/> Launched by PSLV C60 on December 30, 2024, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota.</p>
<h2>Trial Update</h2>
<ul>
<li>The satellites were brought within 3 meters of each other during a trial attempt.</li>
<li>The initial separation was 15 meters, successfully reduced to 3 meters before a safe distance was maintained.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setback and Recovery</h2>
<ul>
<li>An unexpected drift between the satellites delayed the docking attempt from January 7 to January 8.</li>
<li>ISRO overcame the drift issue and is analyzing data for the next docking attempt.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Significance of the Mission</h2>
<ul>
<li>Key to developing future space technologies for missions like sending an Indian astronaut to the moon.</li>
<li>Positioning India alongside U.S., Russia, and China in spacecraft docking expertise.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Docking will be attempted after further data analysis, with the potential to join the ranks of countries that have mastered spacecraft docking.</p>
