<p>India has gained global prominence due to its economic growth, political stability, and autonomous foreign policy. Key successes include the G20 presidency, leadership in vaccine diplomacy, and a strong position during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, alongside advocacy for the Global South.</p>
<h2>Challenges Faced by the MEA</h2>
<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is understaffed with only 850 Indian Foreign Service officers for 193 embassies and consulates worldwide. This is significantly lower compared to the U.S. (14,500), U.K. (4,600), and Russia (4,500). With an intake of only 32-35 officers annually, it will take decades to reach the ideal workforce of 1,500 officers.</p>
<h2>Recommendations for Improvement</h2>
<p>To address these challenges, the following measures are proposed:
            <ul>
<li>Lateral hiring from other government services.</li>
<li>Internal restructuring of the MEA.</li>
<li>Improved incentives for officers stationed in India.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Issues with Diplomatic Expertise</h2>
<p>Language training often becomes irrelevant due to frequent postings, and there is a need for a balance between generalist and specialist roles, especially in emerging fields like cybersecurity, space policy, and AI.</p>
<h2>Technological Adaptation</h2>
<p>The MEA needs to build capacity in emerging technologies to handle specialized areas requiring domain expertise.</p>
<h2>Positive Steps Taken</h2>
<p>The MEA has established divisions like Policy, Planning, and Research, and the Centre for Contemporary China Studies. Under the leadership of Dr. S. Jaishankar, India's foreign policy has adapted and aligned with its long-term goals.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>As India moves towards its 100th year of independence in 2047, the MEA must evolve to meet the country's growing global influence and ambitions.</p>
