<p>In 1970, biologist Susumu Ohno proposed that gene duplication is a key mechanism for creating new genes. Duplicated genes allow for one copy to maintain the original function, while the other can mutate and gain new functions. However, over-production of proteins from duplicated genes can cause diseases.</p>
<h2>Recent Research on Gene Duplication</h2>
<p>University of Nevada researchers discovered that duplicated genes have more methylated DNA, which helps prevent over-expression and allows new genes to evolve. The Max Planck Institute found that random DNA insertions can lead to incipient genes, potentially influencing evolution.</p>
<h2>Gene Retention in Evolution</h2>
<p>For a gene to persist in the genome, it must be functional or benefit from mutation. The ABO blood group system is an example where gene variants have persisted despite some being non-essential.</p>
<h2>Key Concepts of Gene Function and Structure</h2>
<p>The human genome contains around 20,000 protein-coding genes and 20,000 RNA-regulating genes. Promoters and enhancers control when and where genes are transcribed into mRNA. The human genome consists of 24 chromosomes, with males having X and Y chromosomes, and females having two X chromosomes.</p>
<h2>Implications for Evolutionary Biology</h2>
<p>Studies of gene duplication and mutation provide insight into gene evolution and adaptation. Random DNA insertions play a significant role in evolutionary processes, contributing to organism adaptation.</p>
