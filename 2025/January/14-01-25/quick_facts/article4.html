<p>The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have accused each other of manipulating electoral rolls ahead of Delhi Assembly elections. This has reignited the debate about linking Voter IDs (EPIC) with Aadhaar numbers for better electoral roll accuracy.</p>
<h2>History of the Proposal</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>2015:</strong> The Election Commission (EC) launched the National Electoral Rolls Purification and Authentication Program (NERPAP) to link voter data with Aadhaar.</li>
<li><strong>2015 Supreme Court Ruling:</strong> The Court ruled that Aadhaar could only be used for welfare schemes and PAN linking, halting NERPAP.</li>
<li><strong>2018 Puttaswamy Case:</strong> The Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act, prompting the EC to seek amendments to the Representation of the People Act, 1950.</li>
<li><strong>2021 Amendment:</strong> The Representation of the People Act and The Registration of Electors Rules were amended to allow Aadhaar linkage on a voluntary basis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>In 2023, the EC clarified that Aadhaar submission is not mandatory. However, Forms 6 and 6B for voter registration have not been updated yet. The linkage aims to address issues like duplicate entries but raises concerns about the accuracy of Aadhaar data.</p>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Linking EPIC with Aadhaar</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Elimination of duplicate entries from electoral rolls, enhancing accuracy. Over 650 million Aadhaar numbers have already been uploaded.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Errors in Aadhaar database could lead to wrongful rejections. Aadhaar is proof of residence, not citizenship. Privacy risks exist, as electoral rolls are accessible to political parties.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Confidence:</strong> Emphasize the benefits of linking EPIC with Aadhaar to clean the electoral roll.</li>
<li><strong>Amend Forms:</strong> Modify Forms 6 and 6B to reflect that providing Aadhaar details is voluntary.</li>
<li><strong>Protect Voter Privacy:</strong> Address privacy concerns and ensure voter trust in the electoral process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Linking Voter IDs with Aadhaar could eliminate duplicate entries but requires careful handling of privacy concerns, data accuracy, and voluntary participation. Public awareness and updated forms are essential for moving forward.</p>
