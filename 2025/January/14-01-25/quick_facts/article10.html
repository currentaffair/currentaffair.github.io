<h1>Kerala’s Rising MMR and Declining Fertility Rates</h1>
<img alt="Kerala MMR and Fertility Rates" src="kerala-mmr-fertility.jpg"/>
<p>Kerala’s Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is rising, currently reported at 19 per one lakh live births. The State Health Department estimates it to be 29. The increase in MMR is due to a decline in fertility rates, not necessarily more maternal deaths.</p>
<h2>Declining Births and Fertility Rate</h2>
<p>Kerala's fertility rate has dropped to a historic low of 1.46 (2021 VSR), significantly below the replacement level fertility of 2.1. The state recorded 3.93 lakh births, a decline from an average of 5-5.5 lakh annually in previous years.</p>
<h2>Impact of Declining Fertility</h2>
<p>The decrease in births increases MMR despite stable maternal health outcomes. Kerala’s demographic transition is resulting in fewer births and a future increase in the elderly population, leading to social challenges.</p>
<h2>Demographic Transition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kerala achieved replacement-level fertility in 1987-88, and birth rates have been consistently declining since 1991.</li>
<li>The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) dropped to 1.46 in 2021, with projections suggesting it will decline further to 1.35.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social and Economic Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Migration of reproductive-age individuals for jobs or education contributes to low birth rates.</li>
<li>The elderly population is expected to surpass children in the next decade, creating caregiving and welfare challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Delayed Childbearing and Increased Risks</h2>
<p>Rising age of marriage and delayed childbearing may lead to higher pregnancy-related morbidities. This could contribute to increased health risks for older mothers, though evidence is still limited.</p>
<h2>Population Data and Reporting Concerns</h2>
<p>There are discrepancies in official birth registration data and delayed publication of the Vital Statistics Report (VSR), which hinders a clear understanding of demographic trends.</p>
<h2>Health Department’s Response</h2>
<p>The State Health Department’s efforts to address maternal health challenges face mounting difficulties due to demographic shifts. The goal of holding the MMR at 20 by 2030 seems increasingly unlikely.</p>
