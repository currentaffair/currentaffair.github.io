<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Agri and Commodity Summit 2025 emphasized climate changeâ€™s impact on agriculture, with Union Agriculture Secretary Devesh Chaturvedi advocating for a two-pronged approach: adaptation and mitigation. These strategies aim to ensure food security and resilience in the face of climate challenges.</p>
<h2>Adaptation Strategies</h2>
<p>Efforts include developing drought- and flood-resistant crops, improving water management, and expanding crop insurance schemes to safeguard farmers during extreme weather events.</p>
<h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
<p>Mitigation efforts focus on promoting natural farming practices, enhancing soil health, and introducing carbon market incentives to support climate-smart farming practices.</p>
<h2>Role of PACS and NABARD</h2>
<p>PACS are vital for climate resilience in rural India, helping with grain storage and procurement. NABARD supports green lending, green transformation, and funding for climate-resilient agricultural activities.</p>
<h2>Innovation and Collaboration</h2>
<p>The summit also explored innovative solutions such as drone and solar energy technologies to enhance agricultural resilience. Collaboration and technology are key to overcoming challenges posed by irregular monsoons and other climate impacts.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A comprehensive approach combining adaptation and mitigation strategies is essential for building a climate-resilient agricultural sector, ensuring food security and supporting farmer welfare.</p>
