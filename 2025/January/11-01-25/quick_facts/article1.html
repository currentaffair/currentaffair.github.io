<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The war in Sudan between the Army and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has created a massive humanitarian crisis. With tens of thousands of deaths and over 12 million displaced, the conflict has resulted in the largest displacement crisis globally. Malnutrition and famine are widespread, affecting millions, especially children.</p>
<h2>Severe Malnutrition</h2>
<p>Over 3 million children are at risk of acute malnutrition in 2025. An estimated 772,000 children will suffer from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), which is life-threatening without immediate treatment. SAM increases vulnerability to diseases like cholera and measles.</p>
<h2>Famine and Food Insecurity</h2>
<p>Famine grips five regions of Sudan, with collapsed agricultural output, soaring food prices, and violence obstructing humanitarian aid. Millions rely on aid for survival, but inflation and limited resources worsen the crisis.</p>
<h2>Healthcare System Collapse</h2>
<p>The war has caused widespread destruction, including the collapse of Sudan's healthcare system. Hospitals are destroyed, and medical staff have fled, leaving millions without basic medical care. Diseases like diarrhea, malaria, and respiratory infections are rampant.</p>
<h2>International Response</h2>
<p>International aid is hindered by security issues and limited access to conflict zones. Despite pledges from the UN and other organizations, reaching those in need remains a challenge. Political instability has prevented the resolution of the crisis.</p>
<h2>The Future of Sudanâ€™s Children</h2>
<p>The future of Sudan's children is bleak, with disrupted education, long-term health effects, and limited economic opportunities. The ongoing conflict risks leaving a generation without the skills to rebuild Sudan.</p>
