<h1>2024 First Year to Breach Global Warming Limit</h1>
<img alt="Global Warming Impact" src="https://4kwallpapers.com/images/wallpapers/2024-happy-new-year-1920x1080-13221.png"/>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> 2024 is the first year to surpass the 1.5°C global warming threshold, signaling a turning point in the ongoing climate crisis. According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), global temperatures hit 15.1°C, 0.72°C above the 1991-2020 average.</p>
<h2>Implications of Breaching 1.5°C</h2>
<p>Experts warn that this milestone represents a point of no return. Continued warming could push temperatures above 2°C by 2050, with severe impacts on ecosystems and human life. While El Niño effects contribute to year-to-year fluctuations, carbon emissions are the primary driver of the warming trend.</p>
<h2>Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Records</h2>
<p>The annual average SST reached a record high of 20.87°C, 0.51°C above the 1991-2020 average, compounding the effects of global warming. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing even small temperature increases, as each fraction exacerbates the damage to ecosystems and human communities.</p>
<h2>Experts’ Warnings and the Need for Action</h2>
<p>Experts like Joeri Rogelj and Vaibhav Chaturvedi highlight the worsening impacts of climate disasters on developing economies and the failure of global climate negotiations to provide adequate support. Immediate action to cut emissions is critical to prevent further temperature rise.</p>
