<h1>Iran’s Fast-Aging Population Fuels Economic Fears</h1>
<img alt="Aging Population in Iran" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1351036587/vector/aging-society-world-population-aging-problem-workforce-crisis-by-low-birth-rate-compare-to.jpg?s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;k=20&amp;c=8F69geLO6uHnkbcIMDZscQNCoZlkzHxk0xLzTAENfhQ%3D"/>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Iran’s population is aging rapidly, with projections indicating that by 2050, one-third of Iranians will be over 60. This shift is fueled by longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, presenting significant economic challenges.</p>
<h2>Government Response and Public Campaigns</h2>
<p>In an effort to counter this, the government has launched pro-natalist campaigns to encourage higher birth rates. Despite billboards promoting larger families, economic struggles such as inflation and unemployment deter many couples from having more children.</p>
<h2>Economic Impact of an Aging Population</h2>
<p>The aging population is leading to a shrinking labor force, which may result in labor shortages and increased financial burdens on younger generations to support the elderly. Sectors like technology, industry, and education are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<h2>Declining Population Growth</h2>
<p>Iran's population growth has slowed from 1.29% in 2011 to 0.6% in 2023. Economic difficulties, changing social norms, and increased access to family planning have contributed to this decline, signaling potential demographic crises.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Outlook</h2>
<p>Without intervention, Iran's population could shrink by more than half in the next 75 years. The country must adapt with policies that encourage higher birth rates, economic innovation, and labor market reforms to address these challenges.</p>
