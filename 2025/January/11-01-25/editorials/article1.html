<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various sectors globally, and the defence sector is no exception. India, with its growing technological capabilities, is making significant strides towards adopting AI for military applications. The Indian government's vision includes leveraging AI for enhanced military operations, predictive analytics, and autonomous systems. This article delves into the current progress of AI adoption by the Indian military, examining developments, challenges, international comparisons, and the road ahead.</p>
<h3>AI-Based Products Developed</h3>
<p>The Indian military has made remarkable progress in AI-based technologies. One example is the Indrajaal autonomous drone security system, an AI-driven air defence shield that protects against potential drone threats. This product signifies a pivotal step in enhancing the nation's defence capabilities by utilizing AI for autonomous decision-making and threat detection.</p>
<h3>Defence Budget Allocation and AI Investments</h3>
<p>The Indian government allocated ₹6.21 lakh crore ($75 billion) for defence in the 2023-24 budget. A significant portion of this budget focuses on the modernisation and upgradation of defence systems, with AI-based technologies at the forefront. Additionally, foreign investments, such as Microsoft's $3 billion investment in data centres in Telangana, play a crucial role in building AI infrastructure in India, furthering the integration of AI in military operations.</p>
<h3>Challenges in AI Adoption for Defence</h3>
<p>While India is making headway in AI adoption, several challenges remain in fully integrating AI systems into its military framework.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<h4>A. Lack of Digitised Data for AI Systems</h4>
<p>AI systems require vast amounts of data to train algorithms and improve performance. The Indian military's traditional systems are not digitised enough to provide the necessary data, making the integration of AI more complex.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<h4>B. High Cost of Data Centres</h4>
<p>Running AI systems requires advanced data centres that can support high computational workloads. The cost of these data centres is significant, further adding to the burden on India's already stretched defence budget.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<h4>C. Focus on Replacing Legacy Systems</h4>
<p>The Indian military has been prioritising the replacement of outdated hardware, such as aircraft and tanks. As a result, fewer resources are available for investing in newer technologies, including AI, slowing down adoption rates.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<h4>D. Fragmented AI Policies</h4>
<p>Although India has developed a National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, specific military guidelines for AI implementation are still lacking. Furthermore, policies on responsible AI do not fully address military-specific concerns, hindering progress in this area.</p>
</div>
<h3>International Comparisons and Lessons for India</h3>
<p>Countries like Israel and China are far ahead in the development of AI for military use. Israel's AI-driven autonomous weapons systems and China's AI-powered surveillance capabilities set a benchmark for India to follow. In contrast, India's reliance on state-owned enterprises (PSUs) has slowed innovation and limited the competitiveness needed for rapid AI adoption.</p>
<p>India can learn from these countries by streamlining AI policies, enhancing inter-service cooperation, and fostering public-private partnerships to boost AI adoption. The Indian space sector, with successful private sector involvement, is a model for how the defence sector could also benefit from private innovation.</p>
<h3>Recommendations for India’s Military AI Strategy</h3>
<ul class="important">
<li><strong>Develop Robust AI Policies:</strong> Military-specific guidelines should be established to streamline the adoption of AI.</li>
<li><strong>Enhance Inter-Service Cooperation:</strong> The Army, Navy, and Air Force must collaborate seamlessly to ensure effective AI integration.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in AI Infrastructure:</strong> Expanding data centres and improving the digitisation of military data is crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Foster Public-Private Partnerships:</strong> Encourage collaboration between the government and private sector to scale AI solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Responsible AI Deployment:</strong> Focus on ethical considerations and accountability to mitigate risks associated with AI in military contexts.</li>
</ul>
<div class="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>AI is poised to revolutionise military operations in India. However, significant challenges remain, such as the lack of digitised data, the high costs of infrastructure, and fragmented policies. India must accelerate AI adoption by developing clear policies, investing in AI infrastructure, and encouraging public-private partnerships. With the right strategies in place, AI can play a critical role in strengthening India's defence capabilities and ensuring national security.</p>
