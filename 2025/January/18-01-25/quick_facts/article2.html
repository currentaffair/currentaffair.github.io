<h1>Indian Rupee Devaluation and Exchange Rate Policies</h1>

<p>The Indian rupee has recently seen a sharp devaluation, moving away from the stability of the past two years. This is driven by increased capital outflows, rising import costs, and higher crude oil prices.</p>
<h2>Exchange Rate Policies</h2>
<p>India follows a managed-floating exchange rate regime. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) balances devaluation with adjustments to foreign exchange reserves. Post-COVID, the RBI briefly adopted a fixed exchange rate-like strategy but has returned to a managed-float approach.</p>
<h2>Implications of Depreciation</h2>
<p>The rupee’s depreciation can positively impact net exports by making domestic goods cheaper. However, the negative effects include rising import costs, leading to inflation and reduced purchasing power.</p>
<h2>Structural Challenges</h2>
<p>Since the mid-2010s, there has been a divergence between the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and the real effective exchange rate (REER). This has led to reduced export competitiveness despite the rupee’s devaluation, exacerbated by rising domestic inflation.</p>
<h2>Policy Dilemmas</h2>
<p>The RBI's inconsistent responses and lack of clear communication have raised concerns. This situation highlights the need for a more transparent, adaptive framework to address both short-term adjustments and long-term goals such as export competitiveness and inflation control.</p>
