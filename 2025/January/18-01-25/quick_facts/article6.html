<h1>HPV Vaccine and Cervical Cancer in India</h1>
<img alt="HPV Vaccine and Cervical Cancer" src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202402/hpv-vaccine-035539599-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=929UCQf_tV6UR8VeCRXJtvaZFnAzdMJv"/>
<p>Cervical cancer, caused by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), is among the leading causes of cancer in Indian women. HPV is responsible for 99.7% of cervical cancers globally. The HPV vaccine is highly effective, preventing over 90% of HPV-related cancers.</p>
<h2>Current Situation in India</h2>
<p>The HPV vaccine is available only via private practitioners, though NTAGI has recommended its inclusion in the national immunisation programme. Some states, like Punjab and Sikkim, have incorporated it into their immunisation schedules.</p>
<h2>Benefits of the HPV Vaccine</h2>
<p>The vaccine prevents various cancers caused by HPV, including cervical, vaginal, and throat cancers. It is also safe for immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Recommendations</h2>
<p>Challenges include high vaccine costs and low awareness. The recommended solution is to include the vaccine in the national immunisation programme, promote awareness campaigns, and vaccinate individuals before exposure.</p>
<h2>Statistics on Cervical Cancer in India</h2>
<p>Cervical cancer is the 3rd most common cancer among women in India, accounting for 18.3% of all cancer cases and 9.1% of cancer deaths in women (GLOBOCAN 2020).</p>
