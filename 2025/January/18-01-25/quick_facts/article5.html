<h1>2024 Climate Anomaly and Global Warming Impact</h1>

<p>In 2024, global temperatures were 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels, surpassing the 1.5°C threshold outlined in the Paris Agreement. Water vapour in the atmosphere was 4.9% higher than the 1991–2020 average, marking a significant rise.</p>
<h2>Global Warming Feedback Loops</h2>
<p>Warmer temperatures increase evaporation, allowing the atmosphere to retain more water vapour, which amplifies global warming. Water vapour, as a potent greenhouse gas, sets the stage for extreme weather events like heavy rainfall and storms.</p>
<h2>Extreme Weather Events in 2024</h2>
<p>2024 saw catastrophic floods in Sudan, Nigeria, Niger, and other regions, along with the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. The increased atmospheric moisture directly influenced these extreme weather events.</p>
<h2>Oceanic Heat and Moisture</h2>
<p>Sea surface temperatures were 0.61°C above the 1981–2020 baseline. High SSTs fueled record ocean heat content, contributing to more atmospheric moisture and worsening extreme weather events.</p>
<h2>Geographical Anomalies</h2>
<p>Regions such as India, North America, Sahara, Russia, and China recorded unprecedented moisture levels, further intensifying the impact of climate change in these areas.</p>
<h2>Scientific Consensus</h2>
<p>Experts confirm that greenhouse gases are amplifying atmospheric moisture and warming. Although single-year anomalies do not mark the immediate failure of climate goals, they underline the urgent need for effective mitigation strategies.</p>
<h2>Future Risks</h2>
<p>Accelerating feedback loops involving warming, moisture, and ocean heat content pose risks of more frequent extreme weather, glacial melting, and sea-level rise. Global policy responses are crucial to mitigate these effects.</p>
