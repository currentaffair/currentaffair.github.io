<h1>ISRO's Historic Satellite Docking Achievement</h1>

<p>ISRO achieved a historic milestone by successfully executing its first satellite docking experiment, SpaDeX. This made India the fourth country, after the U.S., Russia, and China, to reach this feat.</p>
<h2>Mission Details</h2>
<p>The satellites involved were SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target). Launched on December 30, 2024, via PSLV C60 into a 475-km circular orbit, the docking process included precise manoeuvres and alignment.</p>
<h2>Docking Process</h2>
<p>The docking process was initiated after manoeuvring from a 15m to 3m hold point, followed by retraction and secure attachment. Despite initial postponements due to drift and abort scenarios, the docking was successfully completed on January 11, 2025.</p>
<h2>Significance of SpaDeX</h2>
<p>SpaDeX demonstrated critical technologies that will play a role in future space missions such as building an Indian space station, lunar sample return missions, and manned lunar missions. After docking, ISRO controlled the two satellites as a single unit.</p>
<h2>Follow-Up Objectives</h2>
<p>Future missions will involve undocking and demonstrating power transfer between the docked satellites for in-space robotics and payload operations. The satellites will have a lifespan of up to two years for respective missions.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Strategic Implications</h2>
<p>Precise manoeuvres and ground simulations were required to address drift and abort scenarios. The success positions India as one of the elite nations in space docking technology and enhances space exploration capabilities.</p>
