<p>The government has approved the construction of a third launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Sriharikota. The project is allocated ₹3,984.86 crore with a completion target of 2029.</p>
<h2>Strategic Significance</h2>
<p>This launch pad will act as a backup for the existing two pads, increasing ISRO's capacity to meet growing demand for launches. It will support advanced missions, including manned spaceflight, and accommodate ISRO’s Next Generation Launch Vehicles (NGLVs) set to debut in 2031.</p>
<h2>Enhanced Space Capabilities</h2>
<p>Designed for scalability, the pad will handle a variety of launch vehicles and advanced configurations like the Launch Vehicle Mark 3 with semi-cryogenic stages, ensuring the capacity to manage future space transportation needs.</p>
<h2>Historical and Economic Context</h2>
<p>The existing launch pads have been in operation for nearly two decades, making this upgrade crucial. The project strengthens India’s position in the global space industry by facilitating frequent and advanced launches and fostering technological innovation.</p>
