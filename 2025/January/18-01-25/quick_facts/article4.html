<img alt="BPaL Regimen in TB Treatment" src="https://tbksp.who.int/sites/default/files/inline-images/tab-4-1_3.gif"/>
<p>The introduction of the BPaL regimen (bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid) is transforming TB treatment, offering reduced duration and fewer pills with lower toxicity.</p>
<h2>Advantages of the BPaL Regimen</h2>
<p>The regimen reduces treatment duration to six months, improves adherence, and provides a low-pill burden. It offers enhanced tolerance and reduced side effects compared to traditional regimens.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
<p>Adherence monitoring is crucial as resistance to bedaquiline has been observed. Drug-susceptibility testing and early diagnostics are needed to ensure regimen suitability. Linezolid may cause sensory neuropathy, which requires vigilance.</p>
<h2>Health System Preparedness</h2>
<p>Training of physicians and public-private partnerships are essential to ensure access and affordability, while addressing the high costs of the shorter regimen.</p>
<h2>Addressing Structural Barriers</h2>
<p>TB patients face stigma, and economic support is needed to overcome barriers. Addressing social determinants like poverty and overcrowding is essential for eradication.</p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>A person-centred approach, along with community education and systemic transformation, is necessary to improve treatment adherence and reduce stigma.</p>
