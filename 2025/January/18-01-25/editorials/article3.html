<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
        The anniversary of key events in the history of nuclear weapons and India’s stance on global nuclear disarmament provides an opportunity to reflect on the global nuclear threat landscape. This article delves into the legacy of the first nuclear test, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the initiatives for disarmament led by prominent figures like Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein. India’s role as a nuclear state, its commitment to a peaceful world, and its efforts to lead the charge on nuclear disarmament are critically examined.
    </p>
<h3>Key Historical Events and Milestones</h3>
<p>
        The first nuclear test by the United States on July 16, 1945, marked the beginning of the nuclear age. This development was followed by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, which caused massive civilian casualties and showcased the destructive power of nuclear weapons. The effects of these events resonate today, as we face the continued threat of nuclear conflict.
    </p>
<div class="highlight">
        The 70th Anniversary of the Russell-Einstein Manifesto (1955) was a pivotal moment in advocating for nuclear disarmament. Led by influential scientists, it warned of the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons and called for their abolition.
    </div>
<h3>The Avadi Resolution and India’s Role in Nuclear Disarmament</h3>
<p>
        The 70th Anniversary of the Avadi Resolution (1955) also holds significant historical weight. India took a bold step toward advocating for a world free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). The resolution emphasized the importance of disarmament in preventing global destruction.
    </p>
<h3>Global Nuclear Threats: Current Landscape</h3>
<p>
        As we enter the 21st century, the threat of nuclear conflict remains. Recent developments, including Russia’s nuclear doctrine revision and NATO’s missile deployments, illustrate the rising risks of nuclear warfare. The increasing instability in global conflicts like the Israel-Palestine dispute and the growing role of non-state actors, especially those with access to cyber capabilities and Artificial Intelligence, further complicate the nuclear threat.
    </p>
<div class="important">
        The global nuclear arsenal stands at a dangerously high level, with approximately 12,100 warheads still in existence. Arms control measures and deterrence policies continue to weaken, leaving the world more vulnerable to nuclear conflict.
    </div>
<h3>India’s Position and Leadership in Nuclear Disarmament</h3>
<p>
        India’s stance on nuclear disarmament is shaped by its commitment to a peaceful world. As a nuclear weapons state, India is uniquely positioned to lead global efforts toward a nuclear-free future. The Rajiv Gandhi Action Plan (1988) highlighted India’s dedication to nuclear disarmament, and the country continues to call for a global conference to prevent nuclear conflict.
    </p>
<div class="highlight">
        India's voice is crucial in bridging gaps between nuclear powers and in preventing a global catastrophe. The country must continue to champion peace initiatives to avoid a future marked by nuclear conflict.
    </div>
<h3>Global Denial and Underestimation of Nuclear Threats</h3>
<p>
        Despite the real and immediate threats posed by nuclear weapons, many around the world remain in denial. Events like the 2004 tsunami and recent California wildfires highlight the human tendency to underestimate catastrophic risks until they become a reality.
    </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div class="conclusion">
        As the world faces growing nuclear threats, it is crucial for nations, particularly nuclear states like India, to take proactive steps in reducing these risks. India’s leadership in advocating for nuclear disarmament is more important than ever. With continued collaboration and efforts to bridge the gap between nuclear powers, the global community can work toward a peaceful future free from the existential threat of nuclear conflict.
