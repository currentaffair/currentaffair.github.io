<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As India approaches its interim Net-Zero target, the FY26 Union Budget presents a critical opportunity to advance climate action. The increasing urgency of climate change, coupled with the need for economic resilience against global carbon regulations, makes this budget a pivotal moment for shaping India's future sustainability agenda. This article explores key recommendations and strategies to address the climate challenges through the Union Budget, focusing on green energy transition, circular economy, global trade competitiveness, and strengthening climate resilience.</p>

<h2>Contextual Urgency</h2>
<p>India has just five years left to meet its interim Net-Zero target. Extreme weather events have become more frequent, underscoring the need for rapid climate action. The FY26 Union Budget comes at a time when India's commitment to its climate goals must be fast-tracked, ensuring that both mitigation and adaptation strategies are effectively supported.</p>
</section>

<h2>Past Initiatives &amp; Gaps</h2>
<p>Previous Union Budgets have included notable commitments to climate action, such as the <span class="highlight">PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijlee Yojana</span> (solar rooftop scheme), electric vehicle infrastructure, and the National Green Hydrogen Mission. However, despite these efforts, India’s renewable energy installed capacity (203.18 GW) still falls significantly short of the 2030 target of 500 GW. This gap signals the need for accelerated investment and robust policy support to drive green energy growth.</p>

<h2>Recommendations for Green Energy Transition</h2>
<h3>PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijlee Yojana Review</h3>
<p>Despite registering 1.45 crore applications, only 6.34 lakh installations have been completed, highlighting significant implementation challenges. To address this, fiscal allocations should support the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model, which would allow lower-income households to bypass high initial costs and instead pay for energy services through credit guarantees and innovative financial instruments.</p>
<h3>Solar Panel Manufacturing</h3>
<p>To reduce the cost discrepancy between domestically manufactured and imported solar panels (domestic panels are 65% more expensive), the expansion of the <span class="highlight">Production-Linked Incentives (PLI)</span> for solar panel manufacturing should be prioritized. Currently, India’s domestic manufacturing only meets 40% of demand, underscoring the need for increased domestic production to ensure cost-effective renewable energy deployment.</p>
<h3>Railway Network for Renewable Energy</h3>
<p>The vast land holdings of Indian Railways present an untapped opportunity for renewable energy installations, potentially hosting up to 5 GW of solar and wind energy projects. The Union Budget should incentivize public-private partnerships to unlock this potential, thus contributing to India’s renewable energy transition.</p>

<section>
<h2>Climate Action and Global Trade</h2>
<p>The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), effective January 2026, will impose carbon tariffs on certain Indian exports. These tariffs could affect products worth $8.22 billion annually, potentially levying carbon charges between 20% and 50%. The Union Budget should consider creating a Climate Action Fund to assist Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in decarbonizing and complying with CBAM regulations, thus protecting India’s export competitiveness in the global market.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Circular Economy Transition</h2>
<p>A circular economy could generate ₹40 lakh crore ($624 billion) annually by 2050 while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 44%. The Union Budget should incentivize businesses to invest in recycling and refurbishment technologies by offering tax deductions, accelerated depreciation benefits, and a sovereign green bond framework to finance circular economy infrastructure.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Strengthening Climate Resilience</h2>
<p>India’s low insurance penetration (3.7% in FY24) hampers resilience to climate-related risks. The Union Budget should offer tax incentives for insurance companies providing climate-resilient products and advocate for reduced GST rates on insurance premiums for climate-related risks, encouraging widespread adoption of climate-linked insurance policies.</p>
<h3>Green Finance Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Standardizing definitions for green finance will help attract investment and contribute to India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The Budget should allocate resources for developing the institutional and technical infrastructure needed to implement a climate finance taxonomy, including market readiness programs and capacity-building efforts for financial institutions.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Climate Competitiveness and International Trade</h2>
<p>With rising global demand for low-carbon goods, India must integrate climate competitiveness into its fiscal framework. The Union Budget must signal the government’s commitment to embedding climate action into all economic policies, ensuring that Indian exports remain competitive in the global market while fostering the domestic green economy.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Policy Gaps:</strong> The Union Budget can address critical gaps in renewable energy adoption by removing financial barriers, such as high upfront costs and insufficient domestic manufacturing capacity. It must also support industries vulnerable to global carbon regulations, particularly MSMEs.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Innovation in Financing:</strong> Innovative financing models, such as the RESCO model, combined with incentives for circular economy and green technologies, will stimulate business activity in the green sector and promote sustainable growth.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Global Trade Impacts:</strong> The alignment of India’s climate policies with global carbon pricing mechanisms (such as the EU’s CBAM) will help ensure that Indian exports stay competitive, while also motivating domestic decarbonization efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Climate Finance:</strong> The establishment of a Climate Action Fund, alongside the creation of green finance infrastructure, will ensure India is ready for large-scale climate investments, positioning the country as a leader in the global green economy.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<p>In conclusion, the FY26 Union Budget presents an unprecedented opportunity for India to secure its future in a rapidly changing global climate landscape. By focusing on strategic investments in renewable energy, circular economy, climate resilience, and green finance, the government can drive significant progress towards meeting its Net-Zero target while ensuring economic competitiveness. The successful implementation of these measures will not only help India meet its climate commitments but also strengthen its position as a global leader in sustainable development.</p>
