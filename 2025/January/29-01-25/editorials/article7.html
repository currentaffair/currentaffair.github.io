<title>Alcoholic Tinctures Health Risk</title>
<header>Alcoholic Tinctures: A Health Hazard</header>

<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Supreme Court of India, in the case of Bhagwati Medical Hall vs Central Drugs Standard Control Organization & Ors., highlighted the significant challenge faced by State governments in regulating alcoholic tinctures marketed as homoeopathic remedies. These tinctures, often marketed as natural remedies, pose a public health hazard that has been largely unregulated. Despite efforts by the Union Government, the powerful homoeopathic industry continues to resist effective regulation, exacerbating the health risks posed to the public.</p>

  <h2>The Regulatory Maze</h2>
  <p>The complexity of regulating alcoholic tinctures stems from the convoluted regulatory framework under India's Constitution. The Constitution designates public health and alcohol taxation as subjects under State jurisdiction, but medicinal alcohol falls under Union jurisdiction. This division creates confusion about which level of government should regulate these tinctures, especially when they are sold as homoeopathic remedies.</p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>States are responsible for public health, yet only the Union can regulate medicinal alcohol taxation under Entry 84 of List I of the Constitution.</p>

  <h2>Pre-GST and Post-GST Era: Medicinal Alcohol Taxation</h2>
  <p>Before the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was implemented, medicinal alcohol was taxed at a meager 4% under the now-repealed Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act of 1955. The introduction of GST complicated the issue, as the specific provision for medicinal alcohol taxation was removed. However, the Union has imposed an 18% tax rate on medicinal alcohol, which remains considerably lower than the taxes imposed by States on alcoholic beverages.</p>

  <h2>Drugs and Cosmetics Act: The Concurrent List</h2>
  <p>The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, is the primary regulation for homoeopathic products. However, this Act is a Union law, and any State-specific amendments require presidential approval. The regulation of alcoholic tinctures under this law is flawed, with little oversight by States, resulting in a lack of quality control and inadequate taxation on these potentially harmful products.</p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>This regulatory framework has led to manufacturers of homoeopathic alcoholic tinctures operating with impunity, bypassing both taxation and quality control measures.</p>

  <h2>State Governments' Concerns and Revenue Loss</h2>
  <p>State governments, especially in regions like Uttar Pradesh, have raised concerns over the revenue loss resulting from the consumption of homoeopathic alcoholic tinctures as substitutes for alcoholic beverages. These tinctures are often sold at much lower prices due to lower taxes, making them an attractive alternative for those looking to consume alcohol at a lower cost.</p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>States have attempted to regulate these tinctures under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, but the Supreme Court ruling in the Bhagwati Medical Hall case clarified that only the Union government has the authority to regulate their sale.</p>

  <h2>Health Concerns and Public Health Hazards</h2>
  <p>Perhaps the most significant concern is the public health hazard posed by these tinctures. Unsuspecting consumers, unaware of the high alcohol content, may use these tinctures regularly, which can lead to serious health issues such as alcoholic hepatitis. These health risks are compounded by the fact that tinctures often contain higher alcohol concentrations than many alcoholic beverages.</p>
  <div class="important">
    <p>Studies from Indian doctors have shown an alarming increase in cases where patients exhibit symptoms similar to those of chronic alcoholism, linked to the consumption of homoeopathic tinctures.</p>

  <h2>Rule 106B of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules</h2>
  <p>In response to these concerns, the Union government introduced Rule 106B in 1994, which limits the alcohol content of homoeopathic tinctures to 12% in bottles of 30 ml, with larger bottles restricted to sales to hospitals. Despite this regulation, the homoeopathic industry has contested it, claiming that it impedes their fundamental right to trade. Legal challenges have delayed the implementation of this rule, with litigation dragging on for years.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Litigation and Bureaucratic Delay</h2>
  <p>The homoeopathic industry has repeatedly challenged Rule 106B, citing the lack of scientific evidence for its alcohol content restrictions. Although the industry has faced legal setbacks, including losing cases in multiple High Courts, the litigation continues to delay regulatory action. In 2015, the industry filed 13 lawsuits across various High Courts, claiming that the rule was invalid as it had not been laid before Parliament for the required 30-day period.</p>
  <div class="important">
    <p>The Union government, instead of addressing the issue directly, opted to pursue further litigation, which has delayed meaningful regulatory changes and prolonged the public health risk.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Public Health Implications of Delays</h2>
  <p>Such delays in regulation, particularly in matters concerning public health, have dire consequences. Citizens continue to consume alcoholic tinctures unaware of the risks involved, and many lives have been lost due to the lack of timely action. Bureaucratic inertia and continued legal challenges from the homoeopathic industry have prevented any meaningful regulatory reform.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion: A Critical Question</h2>
  <p>The critical question remains whether any alcohol should be allowed in homoeopathic and ayurvedic products. With other countries considering cancer warnings on regular alcoholic beverages, it is crucial to reassess the use of alcohol in alternative medicine. While these products may not cure the ailments as promised by their manufacturers, they undoubtedly pose a danger to unsuspecting consumers who may be unaware of the alcohol content.</p>
