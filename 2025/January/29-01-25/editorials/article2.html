<header>India and Skilled Migration</header>

<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The relationship between skilled migration and economic growth is often misunderstood. In places like Silicon Valley, Boston, and San Diego, skilled immigrants are not just workers; they are creators of jobs, driving innovation and launching startups. Their presence in the workforce highlights an important reality about labor markets in knowledge economies. In particular, the debate over H-1B visas in the United States rests on the assumption that restricting skilled immigration will create more jobs for native workers. However, extensive research has demonstrated that this approach is counterproductive to innovation and economic expansion.</p>

  <h2>Impact of Skilled Migration on Jobs</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>Studies, such as one conducted by Britta Glennon, show that American companies do not hire more U.S. workers when H-1B visa restrictions are tightened. Instead, they increase foreign hiring, particularly from countries with abundant skilled labor, like India and China. A mere 1% reduction in the H-1B workforce could have a ripple effect on foreign affiliate growth rates, reducing them by 10-20%.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Moreover, for every 10 H-1B positions denied, U.S. multinational firms hire, on average, 8 foreign workers abroad, thus transferring jobs and operations overseas. This counters the common belief that restricting immigration will help create more jobs within the U.S.</p>

  <h2>H-1B Visa Holders and U.S. Job Creation</h2>
  <p>Research indicates that for every H-1B visa holder, an additional 1.83 jobs are created for native-born American workers over a seven-year period. Immigrant-founded companies in the U.S. have historically outperformed native-founded companies in terms of job creation and investment. The National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of America's billion-dollar startups were founded by immigrants. Furthermore, studies debunk the argument that H-1B workers suppress wages. Research by Giovanni Peri shows that wages for native workers rise when foreign STEM workers are hired due to the increased productivity and innovation these workers bring.</p>

  <h2>Wages and Innovation from Skilled Immigrants</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>American Immigration Council challenges the misconception that H-1B workers earn lower wages than U.S. workers. In 2021, the median wage for H-1B workers was more than double that of the general U.S. workforce. Between 2003 and 2021, H-1B wages grew by 52%, whereas wages for the overall U.S. workforce increased by only 39%.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Studies have shown that high-skilled immigration positively impacts native wages through knowledge spillovers and productivity gains. Cities with higher concentrations of H-1B workers, like Silicon Valley, have become global innovation hubs, with foreign-born tech workers comprising up to 71% of the workforce.</p>

  <h2>The Importance of Skilled Immigrants for Innovation</h2>
  <p>Studies, such as those in the Journal of Labor Economics, indicate that a 10% increase in foreign STEM workers leads to a 0.5%-0.6% rise in native wages and a 0.3%-0.7% increase in patents per capita. Furthermore, a 1% increase in immigrant college graduates results in a 9%-18% rise in patents per capita, driving innovation. With nearly 71% of tech workers in Silicon Valley being foreign-born, restricting skilled immigration could undermine the very foundation of America’s technological leadership.</p>

  <h2>India’s Experience: 'Brain Circulation'</h2>
  <p>India, which receives around 70% of all H-1B visas annually, is experiencing a shift in perception from "brain drain" to "brain circulation." The skills and experience gained by Indians abroad play a critical role in enhancing India’s tech sector and innovation ecosystem. Skilled migration benefits both the sending and receiving countries, fostering a global exchange of knowledge and talent.</p>

  <h2>The Role of Immigration Policies</h2>
  <p>Blanket restrictions on skilled immigration are not effective solutions. Instead, nuanced immigration policies should focus on the complementary relationship between foreign talent and domestic job creation. The H-1B visa regime needs greater flexibility to adapt to market demands. Visa caps should be adjusted to reflect actual needs, rather than artificially restricting supply, which limits American companies' ability to scale.</p>

  <h2>Fast-Track Processing and Entrepreneurial Pathways</h2>
  <p>Recognizing the critical role of skilled immigration, it is essential to establish fast-track processing for critical skills and create pathways for entrepreneurs who drive innovation. Providing opportunities for permanent residency for STEM graduates could allow foreign students trained in U.S. universities to seamlessly transition to the workforce.</p>

  <h2>The Talent Flywheel</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>While the H-1B debate unfolds in the U.S., India must transform its approach to skilled migration, positioning itself as an active participant in global innovation networks. Outward migration should not only focus on talent export but also generate inward flows of knowledge, capital, and innovation.</p>
  </div>

<section>
  <h2>Three Pillars of Transformation</h2>
  <h3>Creating Innovation Clusters</h3>
  <p>India must focus on creating specialized innovation clusters that meet global standards, offer tax incentives, and provide research grants to foster innovation and talent development.</p>

  <h3>Shifting Towards Setting New Paradigms</h3>
  <p>India must move beyond merely catching up with global standards and instead focus on setting new paradigms. Examples such as IndiaStack and UPI show the power of innovation in setting global standards.</p>

  <h3>Building a True Innovation Ecosystem</h3>
  <p>India must cultivate an innovation ecosystem that encourages risk-taking, experimentation, and global collaboration. Introducing a startup visa program could attract global entrepreneurs to build and innovate in India.</p>
</section>

<section class="conclusion">
  <p>In conclusion, the debate on skilled migration must focus on maintaining a balance between short-term wins, such as streamlined OCI processes, and long-term transformation. India must approach skilled migration as a dynamic tool for global innovation, ensuring that both domestic job creation and international collaboration are maximized for mutual benefit.</p>
