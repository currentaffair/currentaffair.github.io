<header>MEA Budget and Diplomacy</header>
<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is crucial in shaping India’s global presence. However, it remains one of the least-funded Ministries, which limits its ability to project India’s diplomatic aspirations on the world stage. While the budget for the MEA saw a rare 23% spike in 2024, the funds allocated remain insufficient for achieving India’s growing global ambitions. This article explores the significance of MEA's budget, its impact on India's foreign policy, and the need for a greater financial commitment to enhance India’s diplomatic outreach.</p>

<h2>Global Ambitions and MEA's Role</h2>
<p>India is striving to become a global leader by 2047 under the vision of a 'Viksit Bharat'. This requires fostering strong global partnerships, especially through regional ties and international collaboration. Key areas where India is working to strengthen its global influence include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leading the Global South</li>
<li>Strengthening ties with ASEAN nations</li>
<li>Enhancing regional connectivity</li>
<li>Engaging with the Quad nations (India, Australia, Japan, and the U.S.)</li>
<li>Establishing international institutions like the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)</li>
</ul>

        These efforts are part of India's broader strategy to assert itself as a prominent global leader in various fields.

<h2>Impact of Insufficient Budget on MEA's Plans</h2>
<p>Despite India’s growing global ambitions, the MEA’s budget remains inadequate for fulfilling its diplomatic commitments. The current allocation is only 0.4% of the nation’s overall expenditure, which is far below the level required to meet the growing expectations of partner countries. Timely project delivery, financial support, and diplomatic follow-through are some of the key demands from India’s global partners that require enhanced funding for the MEA.</p>
<div class="important">
        In 2022, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs recommended raising the MEA’s budget to 1% of the total budget. While such an increase seems unlikely, even a gradual increase to 0.6% or 0.8% would demonstrate India’s commitment to its diplomatic initiatives.

<h2>Two Key Areas Needing Budgetary Focus</h2>
<p>The MEA’s budget must focus on two crucial areas to enhance India’s diplomatic effectiveness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Tools for Regional Integration and Cooperation:</strong> Enhanced financial backing is essential for advancing connectivity initiatives in South Asia, particularly in light of China's growing influence.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional Capacity Building:</strong> Expanding human resources and research capabilities within the MEA is critical to sustaining India’s diplomatic momentum.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2024, India faced new challenges in regional connectivity, including changes in Bangladesh’s regime, Myanmar’s instability, strained ties with Nepal, and the Maldives’ opposition to India’s presence. Despite these hurdles, visits by Sri Lanka’s President and Bhutan’s Prime Minister helped to solidify commitments to cross-border projects.</p>

<h2>Foreign Aid and Shifting Patterns</h2>
<p>India's foreign aid budget saw a decline of 10% in 2024-25, while loans to foreign governments increased by 29%. Notably, 50% of India’s grants go to neighboring countries. This shift from grants to loans reflects India's growing focus on sustainable infrastructure financing, but it also places more responsibility on India’s diplomatic machinery to manage these loans effectively.</p>
<div class="highlight">
        Approximately 45% of lines of credit (LoCs) are directed to India's neighborhood, with Bangladesh being the largest recipient of $7.86 billion. While LoCs offer long-term financial support, they also require robust disbursement and oversight mechanisms.

<h2>Aid to Neighboring Countries</h2>
<p>India continues to prioritize aid to its neighboring countries. Bhutan remains the largest recipient of Indian aid, driven by historical ties and a new focus on energy interdependence, including hydropower development and sub-regional grid connectivity. Conversely, aid to Bangladesh declined from ₹200 crore in 2023-24 to ₹120 crore in 2024-25, while Sri Lanka saw a 63% increase in its allocation. This shift highlights the evolving geopolitical dynamics in South Asia and the need for strategic financial support to foster regional stability.</p>

<h2>MEA's Institutional Capacity and Resources</h2>
<p>The MEA’s institutional capacity is essential for supporting long-term diplomatic growth. Key resources include a strong Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and an expert research ecosystem. However, the IFS remains chronically understaffed, and challenges such as coordination inefficiencies and limited lateral entry efforts hinder progress. The MEA's training budget saw a 30% increase in 2024-25, but overall capacity-building efforts remain insufficient to meet the demands of India’s diplomatic growth.</p>

<h2>Budget Allocation for Foreign Missions and Cultural Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The MEA allocated a modest increase in funding for foreign missions, training programs, and cultural diplomacy in 2024. However, key academic institutions like Nalanda University and South Asian University saw cuts in their budgets. While the MEA continues to invest in international conferences and dialogues, more funding is needed for policy-relevant and evidence-based research at Indian universities and think tanks to support India's global aspirations.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Declassification and Digitisation</h2>
<p>According to the External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, India’s diplomatic track has often been ahead of its foreign policy decision-making. To improve diplomatic transparency and enhance India’s historical understanding, the MEA should allocate resources in the next budget for the declassification and digitisation of its records. Public access to these records would allow scholars to better understand India’s diplomatic history and provide insights into the constraints and decisions shaping its foreign policy. This initiative could also help current MEA decision-makers learn from past successes and avoid repeating mistakes.</p>
