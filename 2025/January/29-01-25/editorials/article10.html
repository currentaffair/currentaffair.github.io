    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) plays a pivotal role in shaping India’s foreign policy. Although annual budgets in India often focus on taxation, infrastructure, and defense, the MEA’s financial allocation is crucial for India to assert itself as a global leader. This article analyzes the recent changes in the MEA's budget, its efficiency, and the impact of its financial limitations on India's foreign policy ambitions. We also explore suggestions for increasing the MEA’s budget to help realize India’s vision for 2047.</p>

    <h2>Budget Growth and Financial Efficiency</h2>
    <h3>Budget Growth</h3>
    <p>The MEA’s budget for the 2024-25 fiscal year saw an impressive 23% increase. This growth is a significant jump from the modest 4% annual increase observed between 2017 and 2023. Despite this boost, the MEA continues to be one of India’s least-funded ministries, with its allocation making up only 0.4% of the total national budget. This low percentage limits the MEA’s capacity to fulfill India’s growing foreign policy objectives.</p>

    <h3>Efficiency of Fund Utilization</h3>
    <p>One positive aspect of the MEA’s financial management is its ability to efficiently use its allocated budget. The ministry consistently meets more than 96% of revised estimates, demonstrating that it makes the most of the available resources. However, the financial capacity is still insufficient to meet the demands of India’s expanding global ambitions.</p>

    <h2>India’s Foreign Policy Ambitions</h2>
    <h3>Global Vision for 2047</h3>
    <p>India’s aspiration to become a “Viksit Bharat” (Developed India) by 2047 requires strong global partnerships and an enhanced foreign policy capacity. India is positioning itself as a leader of the Global South and has been actively strengthening relationships with regional groupings such as ASEAN and the Quad (India, Australia, Japan, and the U.S.). It is also spearheading global initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.</p>

    <h3>Impact of Limited Budget</h3>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p>While India’s foreign policy ambitions are growing, partner countries expect more diplomatic engagement, financial support, and timely project deliveries. The current MEA budget, however, falls short of meeting these rising expectations. This shortfall risks hindering India’s efforts to enhance its global leadership role.</p>

    <h2>Recommendations for Budgetary Increase</h2>
    <h3>Parliamentary Committee Suggestion</h3>
    <p>In 2022, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs suggested that the MEA’s budget should be increased to 1% of the total Union Budget. A more gradual increase to 0.6%-0.8% would signal India’s commitment to global leadership and allow for more comprehensive foreign policy initiatives.</p>

    <h3>Focus Areas for Funding</h3>
    <h4>Economic Tools for Regional Integration</h4>
    <p>To strengthen regional cooperation and combat China’s growing influence, increased funding is necessary for connectivity initiatives in South Asia. Enhancing India's role in regional infrastructure development is essential for bolstering ties with neighboring countries.</p>

    <h4>Institutional Capacity Building</h4>
    <p>The MEA’s diplomatic strength depends heavily on bolstering its human resources, research capabilities, and institutional infrastructure. Expanding the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and providing specialized research expertise are crucial for India’s diplomatic success. These efforts will empower India to pursue a more assertive foreign policy on the global stage.</p>

    <h2>Foreign Aid Shifts</h2>
    <h3>Decline in Aid, Rise in Loans</h3>
    <p>India’s foreign aid budget saw a 10% decline in the 2024-25 fiscal year. Conversely, loans to foreign countries increased by 29%, shifting towards Lines of Credit (LoCs). This shift reflects a strategic move towards sustainable infrastructure financing, but it also requires effective monitoring and accountability to ensure the loans are used productively.</p>

    <h3>Neighbourhood Focus</h3>
    <div class="important">
        <p>A significant portion of India’s loans (45%) is directed towards its neighboring countries, with Bangladesh being the largest recipient. This allocation underscores the strategic importance of India’s immediate neighbors in its foreign policy calculus. Additionally, Bhutan continues to be the largest recipient of India’s aid, followed by Sri Lanka, which saw a 63% increase in funding this year.</p>

    <h2>Institutional Capacity and Research</h2>
    <h3>Increased Training Budget</h3>
    <p>The MEA’s training budget for the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) increased by 30%. While this is a step in the right direction, the overall capacity-building efforts are still insufficient. The IFS remains understaffed, limiting India’s ability to engage diplomatically on a global scale.</p>

    <h3>Research and Think Tanks</h3>
    <p>Funding cuts to academic institutions such as Nalanda University and South Asian University, with budget reductions of 20-22%, pose a challenge to India’s long-term diplomatic strategy. Investment in policy-relevant, evidence-based research is critical for shaping effective foreign policy decisions. A lack of robust research capabilities may hinder India’s ability to make informed decisions in the complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

    <h2>Need for Declassification and Digitisation</h2>
    <h3>Historical Documentation</h3>
    <p>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has stressed the importance of digitizing and declassifying India’s historical diplomatic records. These efforts would make India’s diplomatic history more accessible to the public and allow scholars to better understand past successes and failures in foreign policy.</p>

    <h3>Track 1 vs. Track 2 Diplomacy</h3>
    <p>Accelerating the digitisation and declassification process would also help improve the transparency of decision-making within India’s foreign policy apparatus. It would encourage greater public understanding and foster learning about diplomacy within India’s governmental institutions.</p>

<section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>India’s foreign policy ambitions are growing rapidly, but the MEA’s limited budget hinders its ability to engage diplomatically on the global stage. To achieve its goal of becoming a global leader by 2047, India needs to increase its investment in foreign policy infrastructure, human resources, and regional cooperation. A more robust budget allocation would enable the MEA to fulfill its growing responsibilities and enhance India’s diplomatic reach, allowing it to strengthen its position on the world stage.</p>
