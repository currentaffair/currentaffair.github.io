<title>Climate Action Budget FY26</title>
<header>Climate Action Budget FY26</header>
<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>All eyes will be on Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman when she takes centre stage on February 1 to present the Union Budget. As the nation grapples with increasingly frequent extreme weather events and mounting pressure to meet its climate commitments, the FY26 Budget carries the weight of both urgency and opportunity. With just five years left to achieve India’s first interim Net-Zero target, the Budget must take decisive steps to protect those on the frontlines of climate change.</p>
<div class="highlight">
    Previous Budgets have demonstrated the government’s commitment to climate action, including initiatives such as PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijlee Yojana, support for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, viability gap funding for offshore wind energy, and increased allocations for the National Green Hydrogen Mission.
  </div>
<p>Yet, with a total renewable energy installed capacity of 203.18 GW, far short of the 2030 target of 500 GW, accelerated investment and policy support are imperative.</p>

<h2>Strengthening India's Climate Response</h2>
<p>The Budget must prioritise key policy measures to strengthen India’s climate response and accelerate progress on both adaptation and mitigation fronts.</p>
<div class="important">
    Climate adaptation and mitigation are crucial to addressing the impact of climate change, particularly for vulnerable communities. The Budget must focus on both reducing emissions and increasing resilience to climate change.

<h2>Accelerating India's Green Energy Transition</h2>
<p>The Indian government must take significant steps to drive the transition to green energy, including a comprehensive review of existing schemes like the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana. Although the scheme has seen around 1.45 crore registrations, the completion rate is just 4.37%, indicating substantial implementation gaps.</p>
<div class="highlight">
    Comprehensive reviews and adjustments are necessary to ensure that these schemes achieve their intended outcomes.

<h2>Fiscal Approach in the FY26 Budget</h2>
<h3>Prioritising the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) Model</h3>
<p>Fiscal allocations should prioritise the RESCO model, which effectively transforms prohibitive upfront costs into manageable operating expenses for lower-income households through innovative financial instruments and credit guarantees.</p>
<h3>Expanding Production-Linked Incentives (PLI)</h3>
<p>The Budget must expand the scope of production-linked incentives (PLI) across the solar module supply chain. This will help address the critical supply-demand mismatch, with domestic manufacturing fulfilling only 40% of current requirements.</p>
<div class="important">
    This expansion could boost manufacturing capacity and create economies of scale, potentially reducing costs for domestically manufactured panels, which are 65% more expensive than imported panels.

<h2>Leveraging India's Railway Network for Renewable Energy</h2>
<p>India’s vast railway network offers untapped potential for renewable energy generation. The Railways' extensive land banks and track corridors could host up to 5 GW of solar and wind installations, providing a significant opportunity for clean energy development.</p>
<div class="highlight">
    Public-private partnership models should be encouraged to unlock this potential, fostering innovative collaborations for renewable energy production.

<h2>EU Mechanism and India</h2>
<p>The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will take effect on January 1, 2026. India’s exports of CBAM products to the EU amount to $8.22 billion annually and will likely face carbon levies ranging from 20% to 50%. This presents an existential challenge for India’s Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which contribute 30% of GDP and 45% of exports.</p>
<div class="highlight">
    The Budget can establish a ‘Climate Action Fund’ to support industrial decarbonisation, particularly in vulnerable export sectors, and assist MSMEs with compliance and reporting under the CBAM.

<h2>Accelerating India’s Transition to a Circular Economy</h2>
<p>A recent study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water estimates that adopting a circular economy can yield an annual profit of ₹40 lakh crore ($624 billion) for India by 2050, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 44%. The Budget should introduce incentives for recycling and refurbishment technologies, including a weighted deduction of 150% on investments in recycling infrastructure and accelerated depreciation benefits for circular economy assets.</p>
<div class="important">
    Establishing a sovereign green bond framework specifically for financing circular economy infrastructure could further encourage investment in sustainable practices.

<h2>On Insurance Products and Green Finance</h2>
<p>India’s insurance penetration remains low, with a decline from 4% in FY23 to 3.7% in FY24. To strengthen climate resilience, the Budget should offer tax deductions to insurance companies on income from climate-linked policies and advocate for lower GST rates on premiums for insurance products specifically designed for climate resilience and disaster protection.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Standardising Green Finance Definitions</h2>
<p>Standardising green finance definitions could help build investor confidence and help India secure part of the ₹162.5 trillion ($2.5 trillion) needed to achieve the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2030. The Budget should allocate funds to build the infrastructure required to implement the climate finance taxonomy effectively, including market readiness programs, verification systems, and capacity building for financial institutions.</p>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Climate-linked economic policies are no longer peripheral but central to maintaining competitiveness in international trade and investment flows. With rising global demand for low-carbon goods and the increasing alignment of capital markets with sustainability metrics, India must act decisively and integrate climate competitiveness into its fiscal framework. The Budget will indeed signal the seriousness of the government’s intent in this regard.</p>
