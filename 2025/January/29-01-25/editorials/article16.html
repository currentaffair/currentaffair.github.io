<title>Ad hoc Judges in High Court</title>
<header>Ad hoc Judges in High Court</header>
<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The issue of judicial pendency in India has reached alarming levels, with millions of cases still pending across various courts, including high courts and district courts. One of the potential solutions proposed by the Supreme Court is the appointment of retired judges on an ad hoc basis to address the mounting backlog. This article delves into the concept of ad hoc judges, the constitutional and procedural framework surrounding their appointment, the current status of case pendency in India, and the initiatives taken to address the issue.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>What Are Ad hoc Judges?</h2>
<p>Ad hoc judges are temporary appointments made to address specific needs in the judicial system, particularly in times of heavy case backlogs or when regular judges are unavailable. Their role is crucial in ensuring timely justice while maintaining the integrity of the judicial process.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Constitutional Basis for Ad hoc Judges</h2>
<p>The appointment of ad hoc judges is governed by Article 224A of the Indian Constitution. This provision allows the Chief Justice of a High Court, with the President's approval, to appoint retired judges to serve temporarily. The procedure for appointing these judges is outlined in the Memorandum of Procedure (MOP), which ensures that the process remains transparent and accountable.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Initiating the Appointment Process</h2>
<p>The process for appointing ad hoc judges is triggered when certain conditions are met. The Supreme Court's ruling in the <em>Lok Prahari v. Union of India</em> case in 2021 set the guidelines for initiating this process. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 20% of the sanctioned strength of judges is vacant.</li>
<li>More than 10% of the pending cases have been delayed for over 5 years.</li>
<li>Regular judicial appointments must be prioritized before initiating the ad hoc appointment process.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures that ad hoc appointments are not seen as a permanent solution but a temporary measure to address the most urgent backlog cases.</p>

<h2>Appointment Procedure and Selection</h2>
<p>The Chief Justice of each High Court is responsible for creating a panel of retired or soon-to-retire judges for possible ad hoc appointments. The selection process bypasses the Intelligence Bureau (IB) check since these judges have already undergone rigorous vetting during their regular judicial tenure, expediting the process.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Tenure and Roles of Ad hoc Judges</h2>
<p>Ad-hoc judges are typically appointed for a tenure of two to three years, depending on the backlog and vacancies in the High Court. They are assigned specific cases, primarily those that have been pending for over five years. During their tenure, they are prohibited from engaging in other legal activities such as advisory, arbitration, or client representation.</p>
<p>The emoluments and allowances of ad-hoc judges are equivalent to those of permanent High Court judges, excluding pension benefits. Despite these provisions, only a few ad-hoc judges have been appointed in the past, with the Supreme Court calling this provision a "dormant" one.</p>

<h2>Ad hoc Judges in the Supreme Court</h2>
<p>Under Article 127 of the Indian Constitution, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) can appoint a High Court judge as an ad hoc judge to the Supreme Court when there is a lack of quorum. This provision ensures that the Supreme Court can continue its proceedings without interruption. However, this appointment can only be made with the consultation of the High Court Chief Justice and the prior consent of the President.</p>

<h2>Current Status of Case Pendency in India</h2>
<p>The backlog of pending cases in India is a significant concern. As of 2024, over 51 million cases remain unresolved, with over 169,000 cases pending for more than 30 years. The situation is particularly dire in district courts, which account for approximately 87% of the backlog.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>The judicial delays are estimated to cost the Indian economy between 1.5% and 2% of its GDP annually.</p>
</div>
<p>Factors contributing to this pendency include a shortage of judges, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of judicial accountability. These delays undermine public confidence in the judicial system and hinder access to timely justice for the common man.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Causes of Judicial Pendency</h2>
<p>Several factors contribute to the high pendency of cases in Indian courts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortage of Judges: As of 2024, India's 25 High Courts are functioning with only 783 judges out of the sanctioned strength of 1,114. Additionally, more than 5,000 vacancies exist in district courts.</li>
<li>Infrastructure Gaps: A study of 20 district courts found that only 45% of judicial officers have access to electronic display facilities, and a significant percentage lack video conferencing capabilities.</li>
<li>Lack of Judicial Accountability: The impeachment process for removing judges is seldom used, and there are inadequate provisions for addressing less severe issues within the judiciary.</li>
<li>Access to Justice Barriers: A significant portion of India’s prison population consists of undertrials, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are unable to navigate the complex legal system due to cost, language, and procedural barriers.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h2>Initiatives to Address Pendency</h2>
<p>To tackle the backlog, several initiatives have been launched, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms</strong>, launched in 2011, aims to improve judicial infrastructure and leverage technology to speed up the legal process.</li>
<li>The <strong>e-Courts Mission Mode Project</strong>, which utilizes Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to enhance transparency and streamline court processes.</li>
<li>The <strong>Tele-Law Programme</strong>, which provides legal advice to marginalized communities through video conferencing and mobile apps.</li>
<li>Strengthening <strong>Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong> (ADR) mechanisms like arbitration, mediation, and Lok Adalats.</li>
<li>The establishment of <strong>Fast Track Courts</strong> to expedite trials for specific cases such as crimes against women and children.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>To further reduce the backlog, the following measures are being considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishment of a <strong>National Court of Appeal</strong> to handle Special Leave Petitions (SLPs), freeing up the Supreme Court to focus on constitutional matters.</li>
<li>Dividing the Supreme Court into a <strong>Constitutional Division</strong> for constitutional matters and a <strong>Legal Division</strong> for other legal issues to streamline the judicial process.</li>
<li>Increasing the number of workdays and reducing vacations, as recommended by the Malimath Committee and the 2009 Law Commission report, to address pendency at all judicial levels.</li>
<li>Creation of a <strong>National Judicial Infrastructure Authority</strong> to address critical infrastructure gaps in India’s judicial system.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Addressing the issue of judicial pendency requires a multi-faceted approach, including the effective use of ad hoc judges, improving infrastructure, increasing judicial accountability, and reforming legal procedures. By implementing these measures, India can work towards ensuring faster justice and a more efficient judicial system.</p>
