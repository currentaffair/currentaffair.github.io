<h1>Dinosaurs' Origins in Gondwana</h1>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The evolution of dinosaurs, one of Earth’s most fascinating prehistoric lineages, dates back to the late Triassic Period. Researchers suggest that dinosaurs originated in the low-latitude regions of Gondwana, near the equator.</p>
<h2>Gondwana's Role in Dinosaur Origins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gondwana, part of the supercontinent Pangaea, included present-day northern South America and northern Africa.</li>
<li>These regions are now separated by plate tectonics into the Amazon rainforest and the Sahara desert.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Evidence Supporting Gondwana’s Role</h2>
<ul>
<li>Early dinosaur fossils, such as Eoraptor and Herrerasaurus from Argentina, Saturnalia from Brazil, and Mbiresaurus raathi from Zimbabwe, show features suggesting millions of years of prior evolution.</li>
<li>Researchers point out gaps in the fossil record in the modern Sahara and Amazon, possibly holding earlier dinosaur remains.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Environment in Early Gondwana</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dinosaurs likely emerged in harsh climates with extreme heat, dry deserts, savannah-like habitats, and some forested areas prone to seasonal wildfires.</li>
<li>Although previously thought unsuitable for early dinosaur survival, evidence suggests they adapted to these challenging conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evolutionary Context</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dinosaurs evolved from primitive reptiles following the mass extinction at the end of the Permian Period (252 million years ago), caused by extreme volcanism.</li>
<li>The sparse fossil record in equatorial Gondwana may be due to unfavorable preservation conditions and limited exploration in regions like the Amazon and Sahara.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>This research reshapes our understanding of dinosaur origins and emphasizes the potential of unexplored fossil-rich regions to fill critical gaps in Earth’s evolutionary history.</p>
