<h1>Secular Inheritance Law Debate</h1>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Chief Justice of India, CJI Sanjiv Khanna, stated that freedom to renounce faith and choose secular inheritance laws should apply to all religions, not just one.</p>
<h2>Petitioner's Case</h2>
<ul>
<li>Safiya P.M., a woman from Kerala, petitioned to be governed by the secular Indian Succession Act, instead of Sharia law.</li>
<li>She renounced her Muslim faith and now identifies as a non-believer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Equality Across Faiths</h2>
<p>CJI emphasized that secular inheritance laws should apply universally, irrespective of religion, and not favor one faith over another.</p>
<h2>Hindu Succession Act Issue</h2>
<ul>
<li>CJI pointed out that under the Hindu Succession Act, converting from Hinduism results in losing inheritance rights.</li>
<li>Safiya argued that this should not apply to individuals who renounce their faith.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Will as a Solution</h2>
<p>Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta argued that inheritance through a Will is still possible, despite the restrictions under the Hindu Succession Act.</p>
<h2>Intestate Succession Consideration</h2>
<p>CJI highlighted complications with intestate succession (without a Will) and joint Hindu family property in inheritance cases.</p>
<h2>Union’s Response</h2>
<p>The Union Government was asked to file a counter-affidavit in response to the petition, due to the importance of the issue.</p>
<h2>Religion in Official Forms</h2>
<p>CJI suggested that if the petition succeeds, individuals should have the option to not mention their religion on official forms, protecting their right to privacy.</p>
<h2>Advocate's Argument</h2>
<p>Advocate Prashant Padmanabhan argued that Safiya, as a non-believer, should not face any disqualification in inheritance rights or civil rights due to her religious choice, invoking secularism under the Constitution.</p>
<h2>Inheritance Under Muslim Law</h2>
<p>Safiya argued that under Muslim law, she would inherit only one-third of her father’s property, which complicates her situation due to her care responsibilities for her autistic brother.</p>
<h2>Legal Vacuum</h2>
<p>Safiya’s petition highlighted a legal gap, where even with a "no-religion, no-caste" certificate, she faced barriers to inheriting her parental property, violating her fundamental right to belief under Article 25 of the Indian Constitution.</p>
