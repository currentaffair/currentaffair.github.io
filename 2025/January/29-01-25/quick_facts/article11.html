    <h2>What is GBS?</h2>
    <p>Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder where the body’s immune system attacks the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness and potentially paralysis. It affects around 1-2 per 1,00,000 people, with adults and males being more commonly affected.</p>

    <h2>Outbreak in Pune (2025)</h2>
    <p>As of January 25, 2025, Pune has reported 73 GBS cases, with 14 patients on ventilator support. A Rapid Response Team has been deployed to investigate the cause.</p>

    <h2>Causes of GBS</h2>
    <p>The exact cause of GBS is unknown, but it is commonly triggered by viral or bacterial infections such as Campylobacter jejuni, influenza, Epstein-Barr, and Zika virus.</p>

    <h2>Symptoms of GBS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tingling and weakness, starting in feet and legs.</li>
        <li>Pain in back, legs, and limbs.</li>
        <li>Difficulty walking, climbing stairs, or moving the face.</li>
        <li>Paralysis in severe cases.</li>
        <li>Respiratory issues if chest muscles are affected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment of GBS</h2>
    <p>There is no cure for GBS, but treatments such as plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) can reduce the immune system's attack on nerves. Intensive care and rehabilitation may be required for severe cases.</p>

    <h2>Recovery & Prognosis</h2>
    <p>Recovery can take several months to years, with varying degrees of success. Some may experience long-term effects like fatigue or weakness, while most people make a full recovery. Quick diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent life-threatening complications.</p>

    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>GBS is diagnosed through physical exams, a review of medical history, and tests like Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.</p>

    <h2>Context & Impact in Pune</h2>
    <p>The sudden rise in GBS cases in Pune has triggered a government response, with teams deployed to investigate the cause and manage the situation.</p>
