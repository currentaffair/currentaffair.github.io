<h1>Understanding Oligarchy and Government Types</h1>
<img alt="Oligarchy concept" src="oligarchy-image.jpg" width="600"/>
<h2>What is Oligarchy?</h2>
<p>Oligarchy is a government dominated by a small, powerful group. In this system, power is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, which differs from a democracy where power is distributed more broadly among the people.</p>
<h2>Other Forms of Government</h2>
<h3>Monarchy</h3>
<p>Monarchy is a government ruled by a hereditary leader, such as a king or queen. It can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absolute:</strong> The monarch has complete control, e.g., Brunei, Eswatini, Oman.</li>
<li><strong>Constitutional:</strong> The monarch's powers are limited by a constitution, e.g., Belgium, Cambodia, Thailand.</li>
<li><strong>Ceremonial:</strong> The monarch has little political power, e.g., Britain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Theocracy</h3>
<p>A theocracy is a system where the government is run by divine guidance or officials who are considered divinely guided, e.g., Vatican City.</p>
<h3>Democracy and Republic</h3>
<p>In a democracy, the people or their elected representatives govern themselves, e.g., India, US. A republic is a form of democracy where the head of state is elected, e.g., India, France, US.</p>
<h3>Anarchy</h3>
<p>Anarchy means "no rule" or lawlessness, where no governing authority exists. Historically, Somalia experienced anarchy from 1991 to 2006.</p>
<h3>Dictatorship</h3>
<p>Dictatorship is a government led by a single ruler with complete control, often without regard for laws or constitutions, e.g., North Korea.</p>
