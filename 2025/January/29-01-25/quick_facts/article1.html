<h1>Supreme Court Foundation Day</h1>
<img alt="Supreme Court of India" src="https://example.com/sc-india.jpg"/>
<p>The Supreme Court of India, established on January 26, 1950, began its operations on January 28, 1950. It was initially located in the old Parliament House and moved to its current building in 1958, inaugurated by President Dr. Rajendra Prasad.</p>
<div class="section-title">Judicial Structure</div>
<p>The Court was originally established with the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and 7 puisne judges. As of 2024, the Court has expanded to a CJI and 33 judges, appointed by the President and retiring at 65. Eligibility includes being an Indian citizen with experience as a High Court judge or a distinguished jurist.</p>
<div class="section-title">Lady Justice Statue</div>
<p>In 2024, a new "Lady Justice" statue was unveiled, replacing the original. Unlike the previous statue, this one has open eyes and holds scales along with the Indian Constitution, signifying equality under the law. The sword has been replaced by the Constitution, symbolizing its supremacy in justice.</p>
<div class="section-title">New Flag and Insignia</div>
<p>The Supreme Court also introduced a new flag and insignia in 2024 to mark its 75th year. The flag features the Ashok Chakra, the SC building, and the Book of Constitution, while the insignia bears the inscription “Yato Dharmastato Jayah” meaning "Where there is Dharma, there is victory."</p>
