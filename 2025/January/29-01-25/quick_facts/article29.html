    <h2>Case Context</h2>
    <p>The Bombay High Court directed the Maharashtra government to implement measures controlling decibel levels from loudspeakers, public address systems (PAS), and other sound-emitting gadgets used at religious places or institutions, irrespective of religion.</p>

    <h3>Background of the Case</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Petition Filed:</strong> The Jaago Nehru Nagar Residents Welfare Association filed a petition over noise pollution caused by loudspeakers at religious places, especially during early mornings and late nights.</li>
        <li><strong>Noise Pollution Norms:</strong> The permissible decibel level in residential areas is 55 decibels during the day and 45 decibels at night. The decibel levels at two mosques exceeded 80 decibels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Court's Judgment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Freedom of Religion:</strong> The court ruled that loudspeakers are not essential to any religion and do not fall under the protection of Article 25 (freedom of religion) of the Constitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Peace:</strong> The court emphasized the need to protect public peace and health in a cosmopolitan city like Mumbai, ensuring the enforcement of noise pollution laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Action by Police:</strong> The court directed Mumbai Police to use mobile apps to measure decibel levels, issue warnings, impose fines, and seize equipment for repeated violations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Essential Practices Doctrine</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Doctrine Origin:</strong> The doctrine, introduced by B.R. Ambedkar, distinguishes between secular and religious practices. The state can intervene if practices aren't essential to the religion.</li>
        <li><strong>Past Cases:</strong> Examples include Bijoe Emmanuel (1986) where the court allowed students to abstain from the anthem due to religious beliefs and Ananda Marga (2004) ruling against public street dances as non-essential.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Way Forward</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balance Between Religious Freedom and Equality:</strong> The state and court must respect religious practices but prioritize equality, dignity, and access to basic rights over practices that harm others.</li>
    </ul>
