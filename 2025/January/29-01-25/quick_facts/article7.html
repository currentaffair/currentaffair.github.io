<h1>Thyroid Health Overview</h1>
<img alt="Thyroid Health" src="https://example.com/thyroid-image.jpg"/>
<p>The <strong>thyroid gland</strong> produces <span class="highlight">thyroxine</span>, which is essential for the body's normal functioning.</p>
<div class="section-title">Disorders</div>
<p>Thyroid disorders include <strong>hypothyroidism</strong> (low hormone levels) and <strong>hyperthyroidism</strong> (excess hormone levels). Swelling of the thyroid is common but not always malignant.</p>
<div class="section-title">Key Statistics</div>
<p><span class="highlight">40%-50%</span> of people may have undiagnosed thyroid issues. Thyroid cancers are curable in <span class="highlight">90%</span> of cases with timely treatment.</p>
<div class="section-title">Symptoms</div>
<ul>
<li>Gradual weight changes</li>
<li>Lethargy, fatigue, and sleepiness</li>
<li>Constipation or diarrhoea</li>
<li>Menstrual irregularities</li>
<li>Persistent palpitations, sweating</li>
<li>Chronic cough, difficulty swallowing or breathing</li>
<li>Delayed growth in children</li>
</ul>
<div class="section-title">Testing and Diagnosis</div>
<p>Thyroid function tests are essential and often included in routine health packages. Imaging and clinical examinations help in early intervention.</p>
<div class="section-title">Thyroid Disorders in Pregnancy</div>
<p>Thyroid disorders are the second most common disorder in pregnancy after diabetes. Early detection is crucial, as changes may persist post-pregnancy.</p>
<div class="section-title">Risk Factors</div>
<p>Higher-risk groups include <span class="important">adolescents</span>, <span class="important">pregnant women</span>, men over 40, and women over 50. Stress, anxiety, and depression can also contribute to thyroid issues.</p>
<div class="section-title">Expert Advice</div>
<p>Regular check-ups and monitoring are critical for early detection and treatment. Even asymptomatic thyroid swellings should not be ignored.</p>
