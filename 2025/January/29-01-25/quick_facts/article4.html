    <h1>Fiscal Health Index 2025</h1>
    <img src="https://example.com/fiscal-health-index.jpg" alt="Fiscal Health Index">

    <p><strong>Arvind Panagariya</strong>, Chairman of the 16th Finance Commission, launched the Fiscal Health Index (FHI) 2025, a framework developed by <strong>NITI Aayog</strong> to assess the fiscal performance of states.</p>

    <div class="section-title">About the Fiscal Health Index</div>
    <p>The FHI evaluates the fiscal health of 18 major states based on five key sub-indices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality of Expenditure:</strong> Measures government spending efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Revenue Mobilization:</strong> Assesses capacity to generate revenues.</li>
        <li><strong>Fiscal Prudence:</strong> Evaluates management of fiscal deficits.</li>
        <li><strong>Debt Index:</strong> Examines debt levels relative to revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>Debt Sustainability:</strong> Determines ability to maintain debt levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Data for the index was sourced from the <strong>Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)</strong> covering the period from 2014-15 to 2021-22.</p>

    <div class="section-title">State Performance in FHI</div>
    <p><strong>Odisha</strong> topped the index with a score of <strong>67.8</strong>, excelling in debt sustainability, revenue mobilization, and capital expenditure.</p>

    <div class="section-title">States as 'Achievers'</div>
    <p>States like <strong>Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand,</strong> and <strong>Karnataka</strong> were ranked highly due to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Higher Capital Outlay (up to 4% of GSDP).</li>
        <li>Revenue Surplus through effective non-tax revenue.</li>
        <li>Low Interest Payments (<7% of revenue).</li>
        <li>Sustainable Debt Management and Low Fiscal Deficits.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">States as 'Front-Runners and Performers'</div>
    <p>States like <strong>Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana,</strong> and <strong>Madhya Pradesh</strong> showed strong fiscal management, while <strong>Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Rajasthan,</strong> and <strong>Haryana</strong> showed moderate fiscal stability.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Aspirational States</div>
    <p>States like <strong>Punjab, Kerala, West Bengal,</strong> and <strong>Andhra Pradesh</strong> face fiscal challenges, such as high deficits, growing debt, and weak revenue mobilization.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Recommendations for Improvement</div>
    <p>States should focus on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Revenue diversification and improving tax compliance.</li>
        <li>Investments in infrastructure, health, and education.</li>
        <li>Managing debt with a sustainable framework.</li>
        <li>Improving reporting mechanisms and following fiscal responsibility standards.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">Way Forward</div>
    <p>The FHI provides a framework to guide policymakers in improving fiscal performance. By learning from top performers like Odisha and Chhattisgarh, states can adopt strategies to strengthen their financial health and contribute to the vision of <strong>Atmanirbhar Bharat</strong> and <strong>Viksit Bharat @2047</strong>.</p>
