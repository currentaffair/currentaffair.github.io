<h2>Supreme Court Ruling</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court has asked Tamil Nadu and Kerala to choose between two supervisory panels for managing the Mullaperiyar Dam. This follows the creation of a new supervisory committee by the Union government on November 21, 2024.</p>
<h2>New Supervisory Committee</h2>
<p>The new seven-member panel will be led by the Chairman of the National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) and include two representatives each from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, along with an officer from IISc Bengaluru and a Member-Secretary from NDSA.</p>
<h2>Committee Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Periodic inspections of the dam</li>
<li>Monitoring safety measures</li>
<li>Recommending safety actions for Tamil Nadu to implement</li>
</ul>
<h2>Historical Context</h2>
<p>In May 2014, the Supreme Court directed the formation of a supervisory committee. The committee was reconstituted, adding technical members from both states. However, it faced criticism from Tamil Nadu farmers and water experts.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<p>In December 2023, Kerala allowed Tamil Nadu to procure materials for dam maintenance work, marking progress in cooperation.</p>
<h2>Legal and Administrative Framework</h2>
<p>Under the Dam Safety Act, 2021, the NDSA serves as the State Dam Safety Organization for inter-state dams. The Supreme Court will deliberate on whether another supervisory committee is necessary during its next hearing on February 19, 2025.</p>
<h2>About the Mullaperiyar Dam</h2>
<p>Located on the Mullaperiyar River in Kerala, the dam diverts water to the Vaigai River in Tamil Nadu for irrigation. Built in 1895 by the British, it stands 53.6 meters high and stretches 365.7 meters in length.</p>
<h2>Interstate Dispute</h2>
<p>The Mullaperiyar Dam has been a source of conflict between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, with Kerala raising safety concerns due to the dam's age and risks to downstream populations.</p>
