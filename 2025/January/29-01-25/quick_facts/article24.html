<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The share of India's Union Budget allocated to key social sectors such as health, rural development, education, and social welfare has been decreasing, posing challenges for essential services.</p>
<h2>Key Sectors Affected</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health:</strong> Dropped from 2.47%-2.22% (FY18-22) to 1.85%-1.75% (FY23-25).</li>
<li><strong>Rural Development:</strong> Allocation stagnated below 6% in recent years.</li>
<li><strong>Higher Education:</strong> Reduced from 1.57%-1.37% (FY17-20) to 1.27%-0.88% (FY21-25).</li>
<li><strong>School Education:</strong> Declined from 2.18%-1.96% to 1.61%-1.23%.</li>
<li><strong>Social Welfare:</strong> Dropped from 1.89%-1.61% to 1.17%-0.97%.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scheme-Level Allocation Cuts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>MGNREGS:</strong> Allocation for 2024-25 is ₹86,000 crore, marking a 10-year low.</li>
<li><strong>Rural Development Shortfall:</strong> ₹4,315 crore shortfall leading to delays in wage disbursements.</li>
<li><strong>National Social Assistance Programme:</strong> Drastic funding cuts for pensions (old age, widow, disability) from 1.21%-0.36% (FY19-21) to 0.2%.</li>
<li><strong>PM-POSHAN Scheme:</strong> Allocations for mid-day meals have dropped to 0.26% of the total budget in FY25, the lowest in nine years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exceptions to the Trend</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ayushman Bharat (PMJAY):</strong> Stable or increasing funding for healthcare access for vulnerable populations.</li>
<li><strong>PMAY-Rural:</strong> Allocations have either increased or remained stable for rural housing.</li>
<li><strong>PM Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI):</strong> Funding for school education in rural areas remains stable or increasing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Need for Action in FY26 Budget</h2>
<p>The upcoming FY26 Budget, due for presentation on February 1, must address cuts in social sector funding, focusing on critical schemes like MGNREGS, PM-POSHAN, and social assistance programs.</p>
<h3>Key Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critical Social Schemes at Risk:</strong> The continued decline in allocations could undermine vital services for rural development, healthcare, and education.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Inclusivity:</strong> The Budget should prioritize the socio-economic inclusion of vulnerable communities, ensuring fair distribution of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability of Key Schemes:</strong> Programs like MGNREGS, PM-POSHAN, and social assistance need sufficient funding to maintain their impact.</li>
</ul>
