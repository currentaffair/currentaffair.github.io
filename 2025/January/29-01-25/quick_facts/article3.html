<p>The Adi tribe in Siang, Arunachal Pradesh, was officially recognized on January 28, addressing their socio-economic challenges.</p>
<div class="section-title">Social Empowerment</div>
<p>Denotified tribes often face marginalization. Recognition can empower them socially by enabling access to affirmative action, including reservations in education and employment.</p>
<div class="section-title">Economic Benefits</div>
<p>Classification provides access to welfare schemes, financial support, and improved infrastructure, contributing to the economic upliftment of the community.</p>
<div class="section-title">Cultural Preservation</div>
<p>Official recognition aids in preserving the Adi tribeâ€™s cultural heritage, fostering participation in governance and policy formulation.</p>
<div class="section-title">Legal Protection</div>
<p>Recognition offers legal protection against exploitation and discrimination, addressing the historical struggles faced by denotified tribes in accessing justice.</p>
<div class="section-title">Challenges in Implementation</div>
<p>Despite the significance of recognition, challenges like delays, lack of effective implementation, and resistance from local power structures may hinder the benefits.</p>
<div class="section-title">Historical Context</div>
<p>Denotified tribes were once labeled as "criminal tribes" under colonial rule, and their recognition seeks to undo this historical injustice, contributing to broader tribal welfare discourse.</p>
