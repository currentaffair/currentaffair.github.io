    <p>Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye known for its bright pink color, is banned in food due to its carcinogenic properties.</p>

    <div class="section-title">What is Rhodamine B?</div>
    <p>Rhodamine B is commonly used in textiles, paper, and leather for its fluorescent properties. However, its use in consumables, like food, is concerning due to associated health risks.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Health Risks</div>
    <p>Rhodamine B has been linked to cancer. Studies indicate it causes DNA damage, leading to mutations that may result in cancerous growths. Long-term exposure in animals has shown tumors in organs like the liver and bladder.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Global Actions</div>
    <p>Countries such as the U.S. have banned Rhodamine B in food products, with the FDA recognizing its carcinogenicity. The European Union also restricts its use in cosmetics.</p>

    <div class="section-title">India's Response</div>
    <p>In February 2024, Tamil Nadu banned cotton candy after detecting Rhodamine B. Other states like Karnataka, Puducherry, and Himachal Pradesh have also implemented bans on the substance.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Way Forward</div>
    <p>Health experts advocate for strengthening India's food safety ecosystem and conducting more research on food dyes like Rhodamine B. There is a need for proactive regulation, better enforcement of food safety laws, and consumer awareness about food additives.</p>
