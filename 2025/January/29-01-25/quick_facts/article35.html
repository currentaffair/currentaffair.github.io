<h1>Union Budget Components Explained</h1>
<img alt="Union Budget" src="budget-image.jpg" width="600"/>
<h2>Overview of Budget Components</h2>
<p>The Union Budget consists of two main parts: expenditure and receipts.</p>
<h3>Expenditure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure:</strong> Focuses on long-term assets, such as infrastructure projects like schools and hospitals.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Expenditure:</strong> Ongoing costs like wages and subsidies that don’t create assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Receipts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Receipts:</strong> Includes tax and non-tax revenue that doesn’t increase liabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Debt Capital Receipts:</strong> Includes loan recovery and disinvestment.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Creating Receipts:</strong> Involves loans and borrowings, increasing liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deficit Indicators</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Deficit:</strong> The difference between total expenditure and the sum of revenue receipts and non-debt receipts.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Deficit:</strong> Fiscal deficit minus interest payments.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Deficit:</strong> Difference between fiscal deficit and capital expenditure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implications for the Economy</h2>
<p>The budget affects economic variables such as aggregate demand, income distribution, and fiscal health:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggregate Demand:</strong> Government expenditure boosts demand, while taxes reduce private sector income.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Trends:</strong> Expenditure and revenue rise with GDP, analyzed relative to growth rates.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Deficit Analysis:</strong> A reduction signals the government’s attempt to reduce aggregate demand.</li>
<li><strong>Income Distribution:</strong> Welfare spending supports poorer sections, while tax cuts benefit corporations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fiscal Rules and Policy Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Rules:</strong> Set by the N.K. Singh Committee, guiding the debt-GDP ratio and fiscal deficit targets.</li>
<li><strong>Adjusting Expenditure:</strong> To meet fiscal targets, government may adjust expenditure, even if it contradicts economic expansion needs.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Current Rules:</strong> The fiscal framework may limit flexibility to address challenges like unemployment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Re-examining Fiscal Policy</h2>
<p>Given contemporary challenges, India’s fiscal rules may need to be revisited to allow more flexibility in responding to economic needs.</p>
