<h1>Role of Dissent in Democracy</h1>
<img alt="Constitution 75th Anniversary" src="https://example.com/constitution-image.jpg"/>
<p>The <strong>75th anniversary of the Constitution</strong> provides an opportunity to evaluate its achievements and challenges.</p>
<div class="section-title">Dissent's Importance</div>
<p><span class="highlight">Dissent</span> acts as a "safety valve" in democracy, allowing citizens to express disagreement with policies and hold government accountable. It promotes public debate and policy changes for social progress.</p>
<p>It encourages critical analysis, fostering an informed and engaged citizenry.</p>
<div class="section-title">A.K. Gopalan v/s State of Madras (1950)</div>
<p>The Supreme Court upheld the Preventive Detention Act, ruling it did not violate the Constitution. However, Justice S. Fazl Ali dissented, emphasizing liberty, justice, and dignity. This decision was later overruled in the <strong>Maneka Gandhi v/s Union of India (1978)</strong> case.</p>
<div class="section-title">Puttaswamy v/s Union of India</div>
<p>The <strong>Puttaswamy case</strong> declared the "right to privacy" as a fundamental right, referencing Justice Fazl Ali's dissent in the Gopalan case and critiquing past limitations on personal liberty.</p>
<div class="section-title">Judiciary's Role</div>
<p>The judiciary must protect constitutional principles, including personal liberty and dissent. Though the Supreme Court has defended these principles, issues like delayed justice and anti-terror laws create a culture of impunity.</p>
<p>The judiciary should embrace <strong>"creative constitutionalism"</strong> to prioritize justice and liberty over procedural technicalities.</p>
<div class="section-title">Way Forward</div>
<p>The judiciary must focus on ethical constitutional values, including a comprehensive interpretation of fundamental rights and addressing the misuse of laws. By aligning laws with constitutional values, India can fulfill its promises of justice, equality, and liberty.</p>
