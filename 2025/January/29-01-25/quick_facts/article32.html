    <h2>Romesh Thapar v. State of Madras (1950)</h2>
    <p><strong>Why in News?</strong> The case set a precedent for free speech under Article 19(1)(a), curbing arbitrary state powers and shaping India's press freedom laws.</p>

    <h3>Key Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Background:</strong> The Madras government banned the magazine <em>CrossRoads</em> for reporting on police violence, which the SC later ruled unconstitutional.</li>
        <li><strong>Supreme Court Verdict:</strong> The SC declared the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act unconstitutional, limiting arbitrary censorship and linking speech restrictions to "state security."</li>
        <li><strong>First Constitutional Amendment (1951):</strong> In response, the amendment added "reasonable restrictions" to free speech, covering public order and incitement to offense.</li>
