    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>On 26th January 2025, India celebrated the 75th anniversary of enforcing its Constitution, marking a journey of transformation from a colonial state to a sovereign, democratic republic.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of the Constitution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adopted:</strong> November 26, 1949, enforced on January 26, 1950.</li>
        <li><strong>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s Vision:</strong> Placing the nation above personal beliefs for nation-building.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Federalism in India</h3>
    <p>Dr. Ambedkar emphasized that the Union and States are co-equal, with Union powers overriding during emergencies. Federalism, though not explicitly mentioned, is fundamental to India’s governance.</p>

    <h4>Judicial Support for Federalism</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>S.R. Bommai v/s Union of India (1994):</strong> Upheld federalism as a basic structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Government of NCT of Delhi v/s Union of India (2024):</strong> Reinforced federalism principles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges in Federal Structure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conflicts:</strong> Between State Governors and elected governments.</li>
        <li><strong>Simultaneous Elections:</strong> Proposals for one-time national and state elections.</li>
        <li><strong>Regional Issues:</strong> Neglect of languages and demands for linguistic equality.</li>
        <li><strong>Fiscal Federalism:</strong> Concerns about the Finance Commission and GST regime.</li>
        <li><strong>Delimitation Exercise:</strong> May intensify debates over Union-State representation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Strengthening the Constitutional Philosophy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protect Democracy:</strong> Safeguard liberty and equality against emerging threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Promote Unity:</strong> Address caste and socio-economic divisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolve Conflicts:</strong> Between the Union and States, ensuring linguistic and fiscal equality.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Leadership:</strong> Foster informed, ethical leadership across sectors.</li>
    </ul>
