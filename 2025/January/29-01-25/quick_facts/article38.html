    <h2>Overview of the Study</h2>
    <p>A recent study published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases identified chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) as a life-threatening fungal infection affecting post-TB survivors in Assam's tea plantations. This is the first study of its kind focused on tea workers.</p>

    <h2>Prevalence of Tuberculosis (TB) in Assam Tea Plantations</h2>
    <p>TB is a major public health issue in Assam, particularly in the Brahmaputra and Barak valleys. The TB prevalence rate is 217 per 1,00,000 population (2019-2021 National TB Prevalence Survey). Risk factors include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Poverty</li>
        <li>Malnutrition</li>
        <li>Kitchen smoke</li>
        <li>Close contact with TB patients</li>
        <li>Congested living conditions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Findings of the Study</h2>
    <p>Researchers studied 128 patients from tea garden hospitals in Dibrugarh district. The prevalence of CPA among post-TB patients was 48.9%, highlighting its significance as a post-TB health issue. Key findings include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CPA prevalence: 17.18%</li>
        <li>Seropositivity in active TB cases: 18.5%</li>
        <li>Higher CPA prevalence in middle-aged male workers</li>
        <li>Assam's CPA prevalence: 60 per 1,00,000 (higher than global average of 42)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Public Health Implications</h2>
    <p>CPA shares clinical features with TB, complicating diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. Recommended measures include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Testing for Aspergillus antibodies in patients with respiratory symptoms post-TB</li>
        <li>Training healthcare providers to recognize CPA symptoms</li>
        <li>Educating tea workers on respiratory health, nutrition, and hygiene</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Related Health Issues in Assam</h2>
    <p>A 2019 study on epidemic dropsy in Assam showed nutritional health risks from consuming oils contaminated with Argemone mexicana, further highlighting health concerns in the region.</p>
