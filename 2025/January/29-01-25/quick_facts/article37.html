    <h2>ISRO's 100th Launch</h2>
    <p>ISRO is preparing for its 100th launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota, with the GSLV-F15 mission. The mission will place the NVS-02 navigation satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit.</p>

    <h2>Early Struggles and First Launch</h2>
    <p>The first ISRO launch occurred on August 10, 1979, with SLV-3 E10, which was partially successful. Directed by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the recovery from the setback led to success with SLV-3E2 in 1980, placing the Rohini satellite (RS-1) in orbit.</p>

    <h2>Mission Evolution</h2>
    <p>ISRO has successfully launched numerous missions, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 SLV missions</li>
        <li>4 Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) missions</li>
        <li>62 PSLV missions (workhorse of ISRO)</li>
        <li>16 GSLV missions</li>
        <li>7 LMV3 missions</li>
        <li>3 SSLV missions</li>
        <li>1 Reusable Launch Vehicle mission</li>
        <li>1 Test Vehicle Abort Mission</li>
        <li>1 Pad Abort Test (PAT) for the Gaganyaan program</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strategic Location of Sriharikota</h2>
    <p>The SDSC was chosen for its ideal features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Launch azimuth corridor for diverse missions</li>
        <li>Proximity to the equator aiding eastward launches</li>
        <li>Large uninhabited safety zones</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Landmark Missions</h2>
    <p>Some of ISRO's landmark missions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chandrayaan-1 (2008): India’s first lunar mission</li>
        <li>Chandrayaan-2 (2019): India’s second lunar mission</li>
        <li>Chandrayaan-3 (2023): Successful mission to land on the moon's polar region</li>
        <li>Mars Orbiter Mission (2013): India’s first interplanetary mission</li>
        <li>Aditya-L1 (2023): India’s first mission to study the Sun</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Record-Breaking Launch</h2>
    <p>The PSLV-C37 mission in 2017 set a record by launching 104 satellites in a single flight, a feat surpassed by SpaceX Falcon 9 in 2021, which launched 143 satellites.</p>

    <h2>Setbacks and Failures</h2>
    <p>ISRO has also faced setbacks in several missions, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GSLV-F02/INSAT-4C (2006)</li>
        <li>GSLV-D3/GSAT-4 (2010)</li>
        <li>GSLV-F06/GSAT-5P (2010)</li>
        <li>GSLV-F10/EOS-03 (2021)</li>
    </ul>
