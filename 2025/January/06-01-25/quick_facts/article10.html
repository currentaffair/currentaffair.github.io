<h1>Avian Influenza Case in Maharashtra</h1>
<p><strong>Why in News?</strong><br/>
        Maharashtra reported Indiaâ€™s first case of avian influenza (H5N1) among non-avian species, specifically tigers and a leopard. This marks a concerning case of cross-species transmission.</p>
<h2>Details of the Case</h2>
<p>In December 2024, three tigers and one leopard at a rescue centre in Nagpur died due to avian influenza. The infection is thought to be linked to contaminated chicken fed to the animals.</p>
<h2>Transmission Concerns</h2>
<p>This marks the first case in India of avian influenza affecting non-avian species, highlighting a growing risk of zoonotic diseases crossing species barriers, as seen in other global cases.</p>
<h2>Response Measures</h2>
<p>Quarantine protocols were immediately implemented to isolate infected animals and prevent further transmission. Staff members involved in the care and post-mortem of the animals are being screened for infection.</p>
<h2>Government Actions</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Animal Husbandry has enhanced biosecurity protocols, including closing affected establishments, restricting personnel movement, and thorough disinfection of affected areas.</p>
<h2>Broader Implications</h2>
<p>This case underscores the importance of maintaining high biosecurity standards at animal care facilities to prevent zoonotic diseases and contamination in animal food supplies.</p>
