<h1>60 GW Medog Hydropower Dam: Geopolitical and Environmental Concerns</h1>
<p><strong>Why in News?</strong><br/>
        The approval of the 60 GW Medog Hydropower Dam across the Brahmaputra river has raised concerns over environmental, geopolitical, and regional security implications.</p>
<h2>Impacts</h2>
<p><strong>Environmental Risks:</strong><br/>
        The dam could disrupt the water flow of the Brahmaputra, impacting water availability in India and Bangladesh, altering monsoon patterns, and affecting the Himalayan ecosystem. There are also risks of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs).</p>
<p><strong>Impact on Communities:</strong><br/>
        Communities in India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh may face flooding, water shortages, and loss of traditional knowledge due to disrupted river cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Geopolitical Tensions:</strong><br/>
        China's control over the river and India's counter-projects reflect growing hydro-hegemony. Lack of water-sharing treaties increases tensions, especially between riparian countries.</p>
<h2>Hydropower Race in the Brahmaputra Basin</h2>
<p><strong>China's Dominance:</strong><br/>
        Previous mega-projects like the Three Gorges and Zangmu dams showcase China's unilateral approach to hydropower. India is countering with projects like the Upper Siang Dam, while Bhutan focuses on smaller projects.</p>
<p><strong>Absence of Cooperation:</strong><br/>
        None of the riparian countries are signatories to the UN Watercourses Convention, and existing mechanisms like the Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) have limited scope.</p>
<h2>What's at Stake?</h2>
<p>The region could face water scarcity, ecological collapse, and vulnerability to natural disasters. Securitization of the river could lead to regional tensions, especially for lower riparian countries like Bangladesh.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p><strong>De-Securitising the Basin:</strong><br/>
        Moving from hydro-hegemony to cooperative frameworks, with a focus on ecological sustainability and disaster risk reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Leadership by India:</strong><br/>
        India should avoid unilateralism and foster equitable river governance in the region, engaging Bhutan and Bangladesh for sustainable water-sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthen Data Sharing:</strong><br/>
        Expand the scope of the India-China ELM to include disaster risk management and ecological preservation.</p>
