<h1>Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 1978</h1>
<h2>Why in News?</h2>
<p>The Arunachal Pradesh government is taking steps to implement the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 1978, by framing rules for its enforcement, nearly 46 years after its enactment. The move aims to address concerns related to forceful conversions in the state.</p>
<h2>What is the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act of 1978?</h2>
<p>The Act was introduced to prohibit forceful religious conversions in Arunachal Pradesh, protecting indigenous communities' religious practices from coercion and external influence.</p>
<h2>Key Provisions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indigenous Faiths:</strong> Recognizes local religions like Buddhism, Nature Worship (Donyi-Polo), and Vaishnavism.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibition of Forced Conversion:</strong> Prohibits religious conversion under coercion, with punishments up to 2 years in prison and a fine of Rs. 10,000.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory Reporting:</strong> Religious conversions must be reported to the Deputy Commissioner of the district.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Push for Revival</h2>
<p>The Act gained momentum following a 2022 Public Interest Litigation (PIL), with the Gauhati High Court's intervention. Organizations like the Indigenous Faiths and Cultural Society of Arunachal Pradesh (IFCSAP) support the revival, as conversion rates have surged significantly.</p>
<h2>Constitutional Provisions Related to Religious Belief</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 25:</strong> Ensures freedom of conscience and religious practice, with certain conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Article 26:</strong> Grants denominations the right to manage their religious affairs.</li>
<li><strong>Articles 27-30:</strong> Safeguards for religious financial contributions and educational institutions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>State-Level Anti-Conversion Laws</h2>
<p>Several states in India, including Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, have enacted laws similar to Arunachal's to regulate and restrict forced religious conversions.</p>
