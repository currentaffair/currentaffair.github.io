<h1>India’s School Enrolments Drop</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the 2023-24 period, India saw a drop of 1.22 crore in school enrolments compared to 2018-19, mainly due to improved data accuracy via Aadhaar-linked student IDs.</p>
<h2>Enrolment Decline Across School Types</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Schools:</strong> Declined by 36 lakh (-2.8%).</li>
<li><strong>Government-Aided Schools:</strong> Fell by 24 lakh (-8.7%).</li>
<li><strong>Private Schools:</strong> Dropped by 21 lakh (-2.3%).</li>
<li><strong>Other Schools (including Madrasas):</strong> Declined by 41 lakh (-44.8%).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unrecognised Madrasas and Schools</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognised Madrasas:</strong> Enrolments dropped by 16%, but schools and teachers increased by 7% and 13%, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Unrecognised Madrasas:</strong> Enrolments fell sharply by 87%.</li>
<li><strong>Other Unrecognised Schools:</strong> Enrolments declined by 56%.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ghost and Duplicate Entries:</strong> Aadhaar-based IDs helped improve data accuracy, but may have disproportionately impacted unrecognised schools and Madrasas.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Education Access:</strong> The decline may affect marginalised communities relying on unrecognised schools and Madrasas for education.</li>
<li><strong>Student Dropout Clarification:</strong> The data does not clearly differentiate between real dropouts and improved data collection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education Gaps:</strong> The decline of unrecognised schools may worsen educational inequality for vulnerable communities.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Challenges:</strong> Balancing regulation and ensuring access to education remains a concern.</li>
<li><strong>Need for Further Analysis:</strong> Further investigation is needed into why recognised Madrasas have declining enrolments despite increased infrastructure and teachers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detailed Study:</strong> Investigate the causes of the enrolment drop, especially in unrecognised schools and Madrasas.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Transition:</strong> Provide resources for unrecognised schools to meet government recognition criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen Outreach:</strong> Focus on enrolment drives for marginalised communities.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Monitoring:</strong> Enhance data accuracy while preventing exclusion of genuine students.</li>
</ul>
