</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is an initiative launched by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. It aims to democratize digital commerce by creating an open network based on open-sourced methodology, open specifications, and network protocols. Launched in April 2022, ONDC seeks to break the dominance of large e-commerce platforms, thereby fostering inclusivity and innovation within the industry.</p>

    <h3>Key Objectives of ONDC</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Democratization of Commerce:</strong> Breaking monopolies and enabling interoperability between different e-commerce platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Empowering small businesses, local artisans, and regional retailers to thrive in the digital market.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Reducing customer acquisition costs and transaction processing fees for sellers.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Bridging regional and linguistic gaps, bringing untapped markets into the digital fold.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Empowerment:</strong> Increasing consumer choices and promoting competition among sellers.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        ONDC aims to foster an inclusive ecosystem for digital commerce, providing opportunities to a wide range of businesses, from local artisans to larger sellers, while maintaining low entry barriers.

    <h2>How ONDC Works</h2>
    <p>ONDC operates using open network protocols that facilitate seamless interaction between its participants. Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decentralized Architecture:</strong> Unlike traditional platforms, ONDC does not own or operate e-commerce services but instead focuses on enabling interconnectivity between services.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Protocols:</strong> ONDC ensures participation from any platform adhering to standardized application programming interfaces (APIs), creating a more accessible network.</li>
        <li><strong>Role Segregation:</strong> Participants on the network are divided into Buyer Applications, Seller Applications, Logistics Providers, and Technology Enablers, each playing a distinct role in the ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="important">
        This system fosters transparency, enabling businesses to operate across various platforms without the need to conform to proprietary standards.
