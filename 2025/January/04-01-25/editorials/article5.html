</header>
<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) is a critical government initiative designed to alleviate rural poverty in India by providing affordable housing to the rural poor. Introduced in 2016, the scheme aims to create a poverty-free India through the provision of housing, financial assistance, and supplementary support to the rural population. The Ministry of Rural Development has placed significant emphasis on accelerating the completion of the PMAY-G targets, ensuring that rural communities receive the benefits in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
<h3>What is PMAY-G?</h3>
<p>The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) provides financial aid and support for housing in rural areas, aiming to improve the living conditions of the poorest households. Beneficiaries are selected based on Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data, validated through Gram Sabha approvals and geo-tagging. It focuses on economically weaker sections, particularly Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST).</p>

<h2>Poverty in Rural India</h2>
<p>Poverty in rural India remains a significant challenge despite ongoing efforts. According to the World Bank, poverty can manifest as deprivation in housing, food, and healthcare. The broadest view of poverty looks at an individualâ€™s ability to function in society, encompassing a lack of income, education, health, power, and political freedoms. Understanding poverty in rural areas requires addressing both absolute and relative poverty.</p>

<strong>Key Poverty Statistics in India:</strong>
<ul>
<li>According to NFHS-5 (2019-21), 14.96% of India's population is multidimensionally poor.</li>
<li>The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) decreased from 29.17% in 2013-14 to 11.28% in 2022-23.</li>
<li>Rural poverty dropped to 7.2% in 2022-23 from 25.7% in 2011-12.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges in Rural Poverty Alleviation</h3>
<p>The challenges of poverty alleviation in rural India are multifaceted. They include dependency on agriculture, which is vulnerable to climate change and poor irrigation, and the high unemployment rate due to a lack of alternative job opportunities. Additionally, limited access to services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure, along with issues like land ownership and social inequality, further complicate poverty eradication efforts.</p>
