        Fertilizer Subsidies: Let the Market Decide
    </div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The rupee’s depreciation, from around 83.8 to 85.8 per dollar between end-September and now, has introduced new uncertainty for both economic agents and policymakers. This article explores the impacts on the fertilizer industry, the challenges faced by the government, and the need for market-driven solutions in addressing the issue of fertilizer subsidies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Impact on Commodities and Costing</h2>
<p><strong>Dollar-Rupee Exchange Dynamics:</strong> For nearly two years, the rupee remained in the 82-84 range, making pricing calculations predictable. The current exchange rate of 85.8 adds a new layer of complexity, as prices now depend on both dollar-denominated costs and the rupee’s exchange rate.</p>
<p><strong>Rising Commodity Prices:</strong> Brent crude has crossed $75/barrel, further straining fiscal calculations. The depreciation of the rupee increases the cost of imports, including critical goods like fertilizers, which compounds the challenges for both the government and the fertilizer industry.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>Fertiliser Industry: The Impact of Depreciation</h2>
<p><strong>Impact on DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate):</strong> DAP is India’s second-most consumed fertilizer after urea. The current landed import price of DAP is over $630/tonne. A depreciation of Rs 2 to the dollar raises the import cost by Rs 1,260/tonne, which adds significant strain on the sector.</p>
<p><strong>Government and Industry Challenges:</strong> Fertilizer companies are hesitant to import due to the increased import costs and uncertainty regarding the government's stance on passing these costs to farmers. The government is committed to keeping the maximum retail price (MRP) at Rs 27,000/tonne, which creates a substantial fiscal burden.</p>
</div>
<div class="section highlight">
<h2>Government Subsidy Measures</h2>
<p>The government has extended a special subsidy of Rs 3,500/tonne on DAP for another year. However, this subsidy does not fully cover the additional costs caused by rupee depreciation. The government faces two choices: either allow the MRP to increase or incur a higher fertilizer subsidy bill, which further strains fiscal resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Economic Implications: A Wake-Up Call for Key Stakeholders</h2>
<p>The rupee’s depreciation underscores vulnerabilities for both the government and firms with unhedged foreign currency exposures. An overvalued rupee previously made it easier for the government to keep prices of imported fertilizers and fuel artificially low for farmers/consumers and allowed firms to borrow cheap in dollars without hedging against exchange rate risks. This current situation highlights the need for a more robust economic strategy to tackle these challenges.</p>

<h2>Way Forward: Recommendations</h2>
<p>The following recommendations aim to address the challenges posed by fertilizer subsidies and rupee depreciation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthen Domestic Supply Chains:</strong> Companies should invest in domestic production capacity to reduce reliance on imports. This will help mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations and foster economic resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Hedging Practices:</strong> Firms with foreign currency exposure should adopt hedging mechanisms to minimize risks associated with currency volatility, providing greater stability to their operations.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Market Liberalization:</strong> Allowing market forces to play a larger role in determining the prices of goods like fertilizers will reduce fiscal burdens and ensure that pricing reflects true market costs, providing a more sustainable solution.</li>
<li><strong>Subsidy Rationalization:</strong> The government should re-evaluate its subsidy policies to strike a balance between fiscal sustainability and consumer affordability, ensuring that subsidies are effectively allocated without creating long-term financial strain.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The rupee’s depreciation serves as a critical reminder for policymakers and businesses to adapt to the changing global and domestic dynamics. While the short-term impact includes higher import costs and fiscal pressures, it also presents an opportunity to strengthen domestic production capabilities, reduce over-reliance on subsidies, and embrace market-driven solutions. The way forward requires a thoughtful and balanced approach to addressing the root causes of vulnerability in India’s fertilizer market.</p>
