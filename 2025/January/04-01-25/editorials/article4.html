<div class="title">FCRA License Renewal and Its Impact on NGOs</div>
<div class="container">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The recent restoration of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) registration for Sambhavna Trust marks a significant turn in the legal and operational challenges faced by NGOs in India. This case highlights the critical role that NGOs play in addressing public health issues, especially in the aftermath of large-scale industrial disasters like the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. The issue of FCRA compliance and overregulation of civil society organizations raises important questions about the balance between national security concerns and the freedom of NGOs to operate efficiently and transparently.</p>

<h3>FCRA and NGO Regulation in India</h3>
<p>The Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) of 1976 was designed to regulate foreign donations to NGOs operating in India. The aim is to ensure that foreign funds are not misused for activities that threaten India’s sovereignty, integrity, or public order. However, the amendments introduced in 2010 and 2020 have added stricter conditions, which have been met with both support and criticism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibition on sub-granting foreign funds to other NGOs.</li>
<li>Mandatory Aadhaar verification for office-bearers of NGOs.</li>
<li>Limiting administrative expenses to 20% of the total foreign contribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tightening of FCRA regulations has led to the cancellation of thousands of NGO registrations, with over 19,000 NGOs losing their licenses between 2011 and 2021 due to non-compliance with the updated provisions.</p>

<h3>Impact on Public Health and Social Services</h3>
<p>Sambhavna Trust has been pivotal in providing healthcare to survivors of the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy. The Trust operates clinics that offer free treatment to thousands of victims who suffer from respiratory, neurological, and reproductive issues as a result of the toxic gas leak. Its work highlights the essential role of NGOs in addressing health disparities where government intervention is insufficient.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The Sambhavna Trust has provided healthcare to over 30,000 victims since its inception. However, with the suspension of its FCRA registration, the Trust faced severe financial constraints, threatening its ability to continue operations.</p>

<h3>Challenges in the FCRA Compliance System</h3>
<p>The case of Sambhavna Trust raises concerns about the FCRA system’s efficiency and transparency. The Trust’s license was canceled in 2019 due to alleged non-compliance, despite claiming technical glitches in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) portal. The prolonged delay in the processing of the Trust’s application in 2023 indicates larger procedural inefficiencies that negatively impact the functioning of NGOs.</p>

<h3>Concerns Around Overregulation of Civil Society</h3>
<p>While FCRA aims to ensure accountability and transparency in foreign funding, critics argue that its implementation has led to overregulation of civil society, restricting their ability to function freely. Several prominent NGOs, such as Amnesty International India and Greenpeace, have had their FCRA licenses canceled, raising concerns about the curbing of dissenting voices and shrinking civic space.</p>
</div>
<div class="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The restoration of the Sambhavna Trust’s FCRA registration is a step towards addressing the critical healthcare needs of the survivors of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. However, the broader issue of FCRA compliance and its impact on NGOs calls for reform. There needs to be a balance between ensuring national security and maintaining the operational freedom of NGOs that play an essential role in addressing public health and social issues. Reforms should focus on improving procedural efficiency, ensuring transparency, and reducing bureaucratic hurdles for NGOs that contribute significantly to the well-being of vulnerable populations in India.</p>
