        Cross-Border Insolvency in India
    </div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The rise of international trade has heightened the complexities of cross-border insolvency. A robust legal framework is essential for maintaining economic stability, attracting investments, and facilitating corporate restructuring. This article explores the evolution, challenges, and potential reforms in India's cross-border insolvency laws.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Historical Background</h2>
<p><strong>Pre-Independence:</strong> India's first insolvency law was the Indian Insolvency Act, 1848, followed by the Presidency-Towns Insolvency Act, 1909, applicable to Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras. The Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 governed mofussil regions. These laws addressed domestic insolvency but lacked provisions for cross-border cases.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Independence:</strong> Despite recommendations by the Third Law Commission (1964), insolvency laws remained unchanged. The 1990s economic liberalization highlighted the need for modern insolvency laws, prompting various committees to suggest adopting the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (1997).</p>

<h2>Evolution of Cross-Border Insolvency Provisions</h2>
<p><strong>IBC, 2016:</strong> The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) focused on domestic insolvency but included Sections 234 and 235 for cross-border insolvency. However, these sections remain non-functional due to a lack of notification and reciprocal agreements with other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Expert Committees:</strong> The Insolvency Law Committee (2018) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Rules/Regulation Committee (2020) both recommended adopting the UNCITRAL Model Law, with endorsements from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance (2021 and 2024).</p>

<h2>Challenges in Cross-Border Insolvency</h2>
<p>India's cross-border insolvency framework faces several challenges, including outdated judicial communication methods, jurisdictional constraints, and lack of implementation of key provisions like Rule 11 of the NCLAT Rules, 2016. A case study involving State Bank of India vs Jet Airways (India) Limited (2019) highlighted the absence of reciprocal arrangements and the "dead-letter" status of Sections 234 and 235 of the IBC.</p>

<h2>Recommendations for Reform</h2>
<p>The following recommendations aim to address the challenges in India's cross-border insolvency framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adopt the UNCITRAL Model Law:</strong> This ensures a structured approach to cross-border insolvency, reducing judicial burdens and transaction costs.</li>
<li><strong>Implement JIN Guidelines (2016):</strong> Modernizes court-to-court communication, enhancing transparency and efficiency in the insolvency process.</li>
<li><strong>Expand NCLT Powers:</strong> Grant the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) the ability to recognize and enforce foreign insolvency proceedings, addressing the limitations of Section 60(5) of the IBC.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>India's current cross-border insolvency framework remains inadequate in the face of globalization and increased international trade. Legal reforms, including the adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law, are urgently needed to address these challenges and ensure a more efficient, transparent, and structured insolvency resolution process in India.</p>
