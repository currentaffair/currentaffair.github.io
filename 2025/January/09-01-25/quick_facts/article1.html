        <h1>Decline in Student Enrolment and School Numbers</h1>
        <img src="https://example.com/student-enrolment.jpg" alt="Student Enrolment Decline">
        <p>Total student enrolment dropped by over 1 crore from 26.3 crore (2018–19) to 24.8 crore in 2023-24, mainly due to changes in data collection methodology and elimination of duplicate enrolments.</p>

        <h2>Change in Methodology</h2>
        <p>From 2022-23, the Ministry of Education (MoE) began collecting individual student data, including Aadhaar numbers. This new approach revealed that previous enrolment figures were overestimated by 5-6%.</p>

        <h2>Reasons for Decline</h2>
        <p>The significant drop in enrolment is attributed to the correction of inflated enrolment numbers, including the elimination of duplicates.</p>

        <h2>Decline in Schools</h2>
        <p>The number of schools under UDISE+ decreased by 87,012 from 2017-18 to 2023-24, with most reductions in government-run schools, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra.</p>

        <h2>Impact of School Closures</h2>
        <p>School closures, especially in rural areas, make it difficult for students to seek re-admission, contributing to higher dropout rates due to distance and inconvenience.</p>

        <h2>Effect on Funding</h2>
        <p>The decline in enrolment raises concerns about the effective utilization of funds, particularly under schemes like Samagra Shiksha, which allocated ₹32,515 crore in 2022-23 despite the decrease in enrolment.</p>

        <h2>State-Specific Trends</h2>
        <p>States like Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, and Uttar Pradesh experienced the largest reductions in schools, leading to accessibility issues and higher dropout rates.</p>

        <h2>UDISe+ Data Caution</h2>
        <p>The MoE cautioned that the UDISE+ data for 2022-23 and 2023-24 is not directly comparable to previous years due to methodological changes. However, key indicators like dropout and retention rates remain comparable.</p>
