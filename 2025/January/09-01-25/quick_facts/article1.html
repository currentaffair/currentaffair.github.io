<h2>Issue: Inaccuracy in Flood Forecasting</h2>
<p>The Central Water Commission (CWC) issued an inaccurate flood forecast for the 2023 Delhi floods, which was caused by obstructions in the Yamuna river.</p>
<h2>CWC Report Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forecasting Error:</strong> The CWC forecasted steady water levels, but the river rose to 208.66 meters, triggering floods.</li>
<li><strong>Obstructions:</strong> Issues like silt deposits, tree growth, and muck obstructed river flow between Wazirabad and Okhla.</li>
<li><strong>Impairment:</strong> Non-opening of the ITO barrage gates worsened the river's ability to carry floodwaters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact of the Flood</h2>
<p>Central Delhi, particularly ITO, faced severe flooding due to the inaccurate forecast and rising water levels.</p>
<h2>Government Response</h2>
<p>The CWC's findings were submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which raised concerns about the forecast's accuracy.</p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen flood forecasting systems with real-time monitoring.</li>
<li>Regulate and maintain infrastructure like barrages to avoid blockages.</li>
<li>Minimize muck and debris disposal near sensitive river areas.</li>
</ul>
