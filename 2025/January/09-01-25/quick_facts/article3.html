<h1>India's State Revenue Dependency</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Over the past decade (FY16-FY25), Indian states' revenue dependency on Central transfers has risen, constituting 23-30% of their total revenue. Meanwhile, both own tax and non-tax revenues have seen a decline.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decline in Own Revenue:</strong> States’ own tax revenue share has remained below 50%, with a growing reliance on SGST.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Tax Revenue Decline:</strong> Non-tax revenue is expected to fall below 24% in FY25, with the Centre contributing a significant share.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency Issues:</strong> States have failed to improve tax collection efficiency, particularly in motor vehicle taxes and stamp duties.</li>
<li><strong>Expenditure Pressures:</strong> Rising expenditure pressures limit states' ability to adopt counter-cyclical fiscal measures.</li>
<li><strong>Redistribution Impact:</strong> States’ reliance on the Centre affects their redistributive fiscal policies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Implications</h2>
<p>States need to enhance tax collection capabilities and reduce dependency on the Centre for a more sustainable and autonomous fiscal future. Reforming inefficient tax collection systems like stamp duties and motor vehicle taxes could be key.</p>
