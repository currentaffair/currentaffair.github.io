<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), spanning 2,000 sites across India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, is one of the earliest urban civilizations. Its undeciphered script hinders a full understanding of its culture, but new efforts are underway to decode it.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>$1 Million Prize:</strong> Tamil Nadu CM M.K. Stalin announced a prize for deciphering the Indus script during a conference marking the centenary of the IVC's discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Political Context:</strong> The announcement connects the IVC script with potential Dravidian ties, reflecting debates over cultural links between the IVC and South India.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dravidian Hypothesis</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proto-Dravidian Language:</strong> Scholars suggest the Indus script may encode a proto-Dravidian language, based on linguistic evidence like the Brahui language.</li>
<li><strong>Deciphering Challenges:</strong> Despite progress, decipherment models are still evolving, with no universally accepted solution yet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recent Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graffiti Study:</strong> A study from Tamil Nadu found that many graffiti marks share similarities with the Indus script, suggesting potential evolutionary links.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Contact:</strong> Material evidence like beads and bronze from IVC-linked areas in South India suggests trade or cultural exchanges between the regions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Prospects</h2>
<p>While there is growing evidence of cultural exchanges between the IVC and South India, further research, excavations, and linguistic analysis are needed to solidify these connections.</p>
