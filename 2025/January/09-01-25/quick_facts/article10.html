<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>UAPA Invocation:</strong> Court questioned whether organizing a protest alone justifies invoking the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).</li>
<li><strong>2020 Delhi Riots:</strong> Khalid, Imam, and others are charged with a conspiracy behind the communal violence that resulted in 53 deaths and 700 injuries.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Intent:</strong> Court emphasized that organizing a protest isn't enough without proof of intent to incite violence.</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp Group Evidence:</strong> Accused linked to a WhatsApp group organizing protests, with allegations of a violent conspiracy.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Clarity:</strong> Court seeks clearer evidence on how UAPA provisions apply in cases involving protests.</li>
<li><strong>Next Hearing:</strong> The next hearing is scheduled to assess specific evidence linking the accused to violent activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Legal Implications</h2>
<p>The court's focus on intent and evidence in protest-related cases could set a precedent for the application of UAPA in similar future cases.</p>
