        <h1>Earthquake in Tibetan China and Nepal (January 7, 2025)</h1>
        <img src="https://example.com/earthquake-image.jpg" alt="Earthquake in Tibetan China and Nepal">
        <p>A magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Tibetan China and Nepal on January 7, 2025, with the epicenter located 80 km north of Mt Everest, in Tingry county, Shigatse region, Tibet. The earthquake caused 95 deaths, 130 injuries, and widespread destruction in China, while the impact on Nepal is still being assessed. Tremors were felt in Kathmandu, Thimphu, and Kolkata.</p>

        <h2>Significance of Location</h2>
        <p>The epicenter lies in the Lhasa terrane, which is crucial due to its infrastructure, including China's largest hydroelectric-power dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which flows into India as the Brahmaputra. Concerns have arisen over the dam's potential impact on river flow, water shortages, and India's interest in managing the river.</p>

        <h2>Hydroelectric Dam Project</h2>
        <p>China's hydroelectric project aims to generate 300 billion kWh annually. The project is situated in the Lhasa terrane, raising concerns about its effect on river flow, with environmental and geopolitical implications for India.</p>

        <h2>Himalayan Tectonics</h2>
        <p>The earthquake is linked to the tectonic collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates, which formed the Himalayan mountain range 50 million years ago. The Indian plate continues to push into the Eurasian plate, generating significant tectonic stress and frequent earthquakes in the region.</p>

        <h2>Historical Earthquake Activity</h2>
        <p>Since 1950, over 21 significant earthquakes of magnitude 6 or higher have occurred in the Lhasa terrane, with the most recent major quake being a magnitude 6.9 earthquake in 2017.</p>

        <h2>Implications for Water and Environment</h2>
        <p>The Himalayan region, often referred to as the "third pole" due to its vast water reserves, is vulnerable to seismic activity. Earthquakes can alter river courses, destabilize glaciers, and increase flood risks, which can impact both the environment and infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>Geological Concerns</h2>
        <p>Understanding past and present tectonic stress in the region is vital for predicting future earthquakes and mitigating their impact on infrastructure and the environment.</p>
