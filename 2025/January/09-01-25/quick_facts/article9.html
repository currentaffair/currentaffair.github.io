        <h1>Tibet Earthquake - January 9, 2025</h1>
        <img src="https://example.com/earthquake-image.jpg" alt="Tibet Earthquake">
        <p>A powerful earthquake struck Tibet on January 9, 2025, causing widespread devastation. The earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.8 to 7.1, hit Tingri County, located 80 km north of Mount Everest. At least 126 people were killed, and 188 were injured, with many in critical condition. The areaâ€™s rugged terrain exacerbated the damage, particularly in rural regions where many houses were made of dirt.</p>

        <h2>Impact and Casualties</h2>
        <p>The earthquake led to the collapse of around 3,609 houses and left significant damage to infrastructure. Tremors were also felt in Kathmandu, Nepal, and parts of Bihar, India. Aftershocks followed the main quake, making rescue efforts more difficult. This is the deadliest earthquake in China since 2014.</p>

        <h2>Rescue and Relief Efforts</h2>
        <p>Rescue teams have been mobilized to assist those affected. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for an all-out search and rescue operation. Locals have received blankets and supplies to cope with the freezing temperatures. Despite efforts, the mountainous region poses significant challenges for timely recovery.</p>

        <h2>International Reactions</h2>
        <p>The Dalai Lama expressed deep sadness over the tragedy, while Chinese officials have extended condolences and assured assistance to the victims. The earthquake highlights the vulnerability of the region to seismic activity, as seen in previous disasters.</p>
