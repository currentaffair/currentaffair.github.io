<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The return of the Taliban to power has altered the strategic landscape for Pakistan, with deep consequences for its security and foreign policy. On December 27, 2024, Pakistan's military reported that 383 officers and soldiers had died in counter-terrorism operations during the year. The country also claimed to have eliminated 925 terrorists, including members of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), during 60,000 intelligence-based operations. However, despite these efforts, Pakistan faces an increasing challenge from the Taliban and its allies.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Strategic Challenges</h2>
<p>Afghanistan, once considered a strategic depth for Pakistan, has increasingly become a "strategic ditch" following the Taliban's resurgence. Pakistan's military and diplomatic efforts to contain the TTP's operations, which are allegedly supported by Afghan soil, have met with limited success. The situation is further complicated by rising tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan over airstrikes, territorial disputes, and conflicting national interests.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Challenges from the TTP</h2>
<p>The TTP's ideological alignment with the Afghan Taliban has created a shared strategic concern for Pakistan. The growing alliance between these two groups is fueling instability and terrorism across the region. Pakistan faces mounting pressure from the public to take strong action, which has led to calls for foreign intervention, including from the U.S.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Misjudgments and Historical Oversights</h2>
<p>Pakistan's history with Afghanistan is marked by strategic miscalculations. Its support for extremist groups and the Taliban, aimed at countering India, has backfired. The unexpected explosion of violence from the Taliban-led government in Kabul is a stark reminder of Pakistan's failure to adapt its Afghan policy post-9/11. The nexus between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP has further complicated matters, challenging Pakistan’s strategic calculus.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Realpolitik and Ideological Rigidities</h2>
<p>The return of the Taliban has been viewed through the lens of realpolitik, but Pakistan's ideological rigidity and reliance on military power have hindered effective diplomacy. The country now faces a complex situation where military action and political reconciliation seem to be at odds, further deepening the crisis in Afghanistan-Pakistan relations.</p>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The growing terrorism crisis, fueled by the Afghan Taliban’s inaction, has left Pakistan with diminishing options for dealing with the Taliban-led regime in Kabul. Diplomatic engagement seems increasingly unlikely, as Rawalpindi's strategic goals clash with Kabul’s lack of willingness to address the threat posed by the TTP.</p>
