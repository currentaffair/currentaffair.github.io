<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The passing of Manmohan Singh should be an occasion for evaluating the lasting legacy of the work initiated in the 1991 economic reforms, which he spearheaded as the Finance Minister. Along with his team of high-caliber economists and Ministers, such as Montek Singh Ahluwalia, C. Rangarajan, and Shankar Acharya, these reforms laid the groundwork for much of India’s subsequent growth. The economic policies during Singh’s tenure as Prime Minister carried these initiatives forward, culminating in significant transformations in India's macroeconomic landscape.</p>
<p>However, the contrast between the period of 2004-14 and the decade following it raises critical questions. By examining verifiable government data, it becomes evident that there were significant outcomes that could have propelled India towards becoming a high-income, high-human development index nation by the 2040s.</p>
<h2>Appropriate Macroeconomic Policies</h2>
<p>India’s economy witnessed remarkable growth during the 2004-14 period, particularly driven by appropriate macroeconomic policies. Some key indicators of this growth include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Savings Rate Increase:</strong> Following the demographic dividend that began in the early 1980s, the savings rate saw a steady rise.</li>
<li><strong>Savings/GDP Ratio:</strong> By 2003-04, the savings rate had reached 23% of GDP, a significant leap from previous years.</li>
<li><strong>Investment/GDP Ratio:</strong> Investment levels rose from 24% of GDP in 2003-04 to 38% over the subsequent six years, a milestone never previously achieved.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GDP Growth from 2004-2014</h3>
<p>Despite global economic setbacks, including the 2008 financial crisis, India’s GDP growth remained resilient. From 2004-2014, India’s economy grew at an average rate of 7.8% per annum, one of the highest growth rates in its history.</p>
<h2>Growth Across Sectors</h2>
<p>The period also saw expansive growth across multiple sectors, both organized and unorganized. Aggregate demand was sustained through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private and Public Investments</strong></li>
<li><strong>Final Consumption</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exports</strong></li>
<li><strong>Government Expenditure</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Unprecedented Non-Farm Job Growth</h3>
<p>Between 2004 and 2012, non-farm jobs grew at a rate of 7.5 million jobs annually, a remarkable achievement in India’s economic history. Sectors like construction and manufacturing saw significant job growth, with manufacturing jobs rising by 8 million, especially in labor-intensive sectors.</p>
<h2>Agricultural Employment Shift</h2>
<p>For the first time in India’s history, the absolute number of workers in agriculture began to decline after 2004-05. This shift in labor force distribution, alongside tightening labor markets in rural areas, was a key structural change.</p>
<h2>Impact on Poverty and Private Consumption</h2>
<p>Increased wages, especially in non-farm sectors, led to a rise in private consumption, which contributed to poverty reduction. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, 138 million people were lifted out of poverty, a truly significant milestone.</p>
<h2>Policy-Induced Shocks: A Setback</h2>
<p>However, in the following years, India faced policy-induced shocks that reversed some of the earlier progress:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demonetization</strong>: This disrupted the unorganized sector, leading to widespread closure of MSMEs.</li>
<li><strong>GST Rollout</strong>: A poorly designed Goods and Services Tax (GST) led to economic disarray, particularly in the MSME sector.</li>
<li><strong>Strict Lockdowns</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns caused the economy to contract by 5
</li></ul></section></body></html>
