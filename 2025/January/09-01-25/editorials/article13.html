<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The term "polarization" has become a focal point of modern discourse, especially following Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This period saw a rise in divisive rhetoric, and the social, economic, and geographic factors contributing to this growing divide were critically examined in Nolan McCarty's book, <i>Polarization: What Everyone Needs to Know</i> (2019). McCarty delves into the complexities of America's polarized society, exploring both the known and unknown elements behind the escalating political conflict.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Political, Cultural, and Societal Divides in America</h2>
<p>In recent years, America has become increasingly defined by profound political, cultural, and societal divides. The election of Donald Trump for a second term in 2024 was accompanied by the widespread use of the term "polarization." This term refers to the division of society into two sharply distinct, often opposing, viewpoints that have become entrenched in the media and public discourse. The term “polarization” reflects this deepening divide.</p>
<h3>The Role of Media in Polarization</h3>
<p>Media outlets like MSNBC and Fox News have significantly contributed to the narrative of an increasingly polarized America. MSNBC labeled the 2024 election as having "left America more polarized than ever," while Fox News cited polarized voter opinions as a key issue during debates. Further, Forbes highlighted that "cultural polarization" was becoming a growing concern in workplaces. Merriam-Webster also acknowledged the rise of new terms such as "far left" and "far right" as part of the discourse in 2024.</p>
</section>

<h2>Divisive Rhetoric and Public Opinion</h2>
<p>The divisiveness of the 2024 election was evident in the rhetoric used by both sides. Vice President Kamala Harris warned of a rise in fascism under Trump’s leadership, while Trump employed derogatory language, accusing his opponent of "destruction." This election saw many Americans perceiving the opposing candidate as an existential threat to the nation.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>According to a poll of over 120,000 people, 80% of Harris supporters were deeply concerned about Trump's radical views, while 70% of Trump supporters expressed similar concerns about Harris.</p>
</div>

<h2>Global Perspective on Polarization</h2>
<p>The impact of polarization is not confined to the U.S. alone. Globally, centrist policies are being eroded, and leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have found their positions increasingly challenged. The "us vs. them" dynamic is shaking political and social structures around the world, as people are increasingly divided by ideological extremes.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Historical Roots of Polarization</h2>
<p>While the rise of political figures like Trump may appear to be a primary cause of today’s polarization, the roots of these divisions go much deeper. According to McCarty, the seeds of polarization were planted decades ago, as American politics and society became more entrenched along ideological lines. Transformations in American culture, including shifts in social relationships, language, and behavior, have contributed significantly to today’s divide.</p>
<p>In particular, the civil rights movements of the 1950s and 60s set the stage for the partisan culture wars of today. Moreover, since the 1970s, growing income and wealth disparities have only served to exacerbate the divide.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Technological Impact on Polarization</h2>
<p>The rise of technology, particularly social media, has played a crucial role in modern polarization. Professor Chris Bail’s work, <i>Breaking the Social Media Prism</i> (2021), investigates the impact of social media on political tribalism. He argues that social media, rather than reflecting reality, distorts it by creating echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs and foster division.</p>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Polarization is a multifaceted issue that is not confined to the United States. While it is often attributed to political figures like Trump, the roots of polarization extend far deeper into historical, cultural, and technological factors. As social media and artificial intelligence continue to evolve, they are likely to exacerbate the "us vs. them" divide. The future of political discourse may depend on how society addresses these deeply ingrained divisions.</p>
