        Pakistan’s Strategic Missteps in Afghanistan
    </header>

    <section>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600" alt="Afghanistan-Pakistan Tensions">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Pakistan’s long-standing strategy of using Afghanistan as a "strategic depth" against perceived regional threats, especially India, is now backfiring. The return of the Afghan Taliban, once considered a key ally, has turned Afghanistan into a “strategic ditch” for Islamabad. This article examines the critical points in this geopolitical shift, highlighting the internal and external security challenges Pakistan faces.</p>

        <h2>Historical Context of Pakistan’s Afghan Policy</h2>
        <p>For decades, Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies supported the Afghan Taliban, providing safe havens and logistical backing to fight against Western-backed Afghan governments. This strategy was rooted in Pakistan’s goal of creating a buffer zone between itself and India, ensuring strategic depth in case of conflict.</p>
        <h3>Strategic Depth Miscalculation</h3>
        <p>Pakistan believed that a friendly Taliban regime in Kabul would provide strategic depth against India. However, the Taliban’s return has destabilized the region, and their control over Afghanistan now poses a direct threat to Pakistan’s security. The notion of strategic depth has transformed into a significant security dilemma.</p>

        <h2>Current Crisis with the TTP</h2>
        <p>The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) shares ideological and operational links with the Afghan Taliban, complicating Pakistan’s internal security. In 2024, Pakistan saw a sharp rise in terrorist attacks linked to the TTP. Despite launching 60,000 counter-terrorism operations, the TTP remains entrenched.</p>

        <h3>Diplomatic and Military Tensions</h3>
        <p>Efforts by Pakistan’s envoy to Afghanistan, Muhammad Sadiq Khan, to de-escalate tensions were unsuccessful. Diplomatic relations worsened when Pakistan Air Force (PAF) airstrikes targeted TTP positions in Afghanistan, resulting in a retaliatory response from the Afghan Taliban.</p>
        <p>These tensions also highlighted the issue of the Durand Line, a border Pakistan shares with Afghanistan, which the Taliban refuses to recognize. This rejection of the Durand Line has revived the idea of Pashtunistan, further fueling tensions between the two countries.</p>

        <h2>Pashtun Nationalism and the Durand Line</h2>
        <p>Pashtun nationalism has become a significant issue, with the Taliban's opposition to the Durand Line and their refusal to recognize Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as part of Pakistan. This has revived the idea of Pashtunistan, challenging Pakistan’s territorial integrity and further complicating the bilateral relationship.</p>

        <h2>Pakistan’s Limited Options</h2>
        <p>Pakistan is under significant domestic pressure to take action against the TTP. However, Islamabad is reluctant to take unilateral action, particularly in recognizing the Taliban regime due to the existential threat posed by the TTP and other extremist groups.</p>

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            Pakistan’s Afghan policy is a case of self-inflicted wounds, with its support for extremist groups now backfiring. The TTP-Afghan Taliban nexus has created significant challenges for Pakistan’s internal security.
        </div>
        <div class="highlight">
            The Durand Line dispute and the rise of Pashtun nationalism present long-term challenges for Pakistan, as these issues continue to fuel Afghan irredentism.
        </div>
        <div class="highlight">
            Pakistan’s reliance on military coercion has reached its limits, and diplomatic efforts are failing. The country faces a complex security dilemma with no easy solutions.

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Pakistan’s historical Afghan strategy of using Afghanistan as a buffer zone against India has backfired. The return of the Taliban has compounded Pakistan’s internal security issues, particularly with the rise of the TTP. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis have faltered, and Pakistan faces a complex security dilemma with shrinking options for resolution. The nation must reassess its policies to address the growing threats on its borders.</p>
