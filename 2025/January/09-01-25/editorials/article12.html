<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Climate finance has been a key issue in global climate negotiations since the inception of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1991. The UNFCCC's Article 4(7) outlines that developing countries’ climate action commitments depend on the financial and technological support they receive from developed countries. The financing mechanisms and commitments have evolved, but a coherent climate finance architecture remains necessary for meaningful progress.</p>
<h2>Paris Agreement and Financial Provisions</h2>
<p>The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, reinforces the obligation of developed countries to mobilize financial resources for developing nations, as detailed in Article 9(1). According to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate finance is critical for enabling climate action in developing countries, particularly in response to human-induced climate change, which has led to a 1.1°C temperature rise above pre-industrial levels.</p>
<h3>Falling Short of Commitments</h3>
<p>Developed countries agreed in 2009 to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries. However, this target was only met in 2022, and many reports suggest it is insufficient to meet the growing climate finance needs of developing countries. Estimates show that financing requirements for developing countries, based on their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), far exceed the $100 billion mark.</p>
<h3>Shortcomings of the $100 Billion Target</h3>
<p>The $100 billion target is seen as inadequate to fund the necessary actions to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century. The upcoming COP 29 meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan in November 2024 will attempt to set a new climate finance goal (NCQG) that reflects the real needs of developing countries.</p>
<h2>Global Response and the Role of COP 29</h2>
<p>In response to calls from the Global South, including major developing countries, the developed North agreed to release only $300 billion annually by 2035. However, this is far below the estimated $455 billion to $584 billion in financial needs identified by the UNFCCC’s Standing Committee on Finance (SFC). Even these amounts fall short of the requirements set out in the NDCs of 98 developing countries.</p>
<h3>NCQG and Vulnerable Countries</h3>
<p>The NCQG, which is being negotiated at COP 29, is expected to address the specific financial needs of the most vulnerable countries, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). However, there is no clear allocation floor for these groups, which remain highly vulnerable to climate change impacts.</p>
<h2>India’s Position on Climate Finance</h2>
<p>India’s perspective on climate finance is framed by the principle of "common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities." India has called for a substantial increase in climate finance from developed countries, including a target of $1.3 trillion by 2030, with at least $600 billion in grants and concessional resources.</p>
<h3>India’s Response to the NCQG</h3>
<p>India expressed disappointment over the adoption of the NCQG without adequate consultation, raising concerns about the fairness and transparency of the process. India rejected the current form of the NCQG, arguing that the proposed financial commitments are insufficient to meet the needs of developing countries, especially in light of their ambitious climate action plans.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div class="conclusion">
<p>In conclusion, while the Paris Agreement emphasizes the importance of climate finance, the scale and quality of financial support must be significantly enhanced to meet the climate challenges faced by developing countries. A coherent climate finance architecture is necessary to ensure that developing nations receive adequate, accessible, and affordable financing to implement their climate action plans. The developed countries must meet their obligations and provide the financial resources necessary to achieve global climate goals.</p>
