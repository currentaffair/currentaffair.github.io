    Cross-Border Insolvency in India: The Need for Reform

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The growth in international trade has amplified cross-border insolvency challenges, highlighting the need for effective regulation. A reliable and predictable insolvency framework is essential for economic stability, attracting foreign investments, and facilitating corporate restructuring.</p>
<p>Under the British Raj, India faced significant challenges in managing financial failures and cross-border commerce. The Indian Insolvency Act of 1848, introduced as the first insolvency law, was later replaced by the Presidency-Towns Insolvency Act 1909 and the Provincial Insolvency Act 1920. However, these laws failed to address the complexities of cross-border insolvencies, leaving a critical gap in the legal system.</p>
<h2>An Evolution of Insolvency Laws in India</h2>
<p>After Independence, insolvency laws remained largely unchanged, despite recommendations for modernization. In the 1990s, driven by economic liberalization and globalization, the need for a comprehensive insolvency law that addressed cross-border insolvencies became a central issue.</p>
<h3>Committees and Their Recommendations</h3>
<p>Several committees were set up to address cross-border insolvency issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eradi Committee (2000)</li>
<li>Mitra Committee (2001)</li>
<li>Irani Committee (2005)</li>
</ul>
<p>These committees recommended adopting the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, 1997, as a basis for reform.</p>
<h3>Drafting of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)</h3>
<p>In 2015, the Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee drafted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) Bill, focusing on domestic insolvencies. However, concerns about the lack of provisions for cross-border insolvency led to the inclusion of Sections 234 and 235, which allow for reciprocal enforcement of IBC provisions in foreign countries and the seeking of assistance from foreign courts.</p>
<h2>Cross-Border Insolvency Challenges in India</h2>
<h3>State Bank of India vs Jet Airways (India) Limited (2019)</h3>
<p>This case brought Sections 234 and 235 of the IBC under scrutiny, revealing two critical issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absence of a reciprocal arrangement between India and the Netherlands for cross-border insolvency resolution.</li>
<li>Non-notification of these sections by the central government, rendering them unenforceable.</li>
</ul>
<p>These provisions were effectively labeled as "dead letters"â€”existing in theory but not applicable in practice.</p>
<h2>Addressing the Regulatory Gap</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Corporate Affairs set up two expert committees to address the regulatory gap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insolvency Law Committee (2018)</li>
<li>Cross-Border Insolvency Rules/Regulation Committee (2020)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both committees recommended adopting the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, which was later endorsed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance in the Thirty-Second Report (2021) and the Sixty-Seventh Report (2024).</p>
<h2>The Urgency of a Cross-Border Insolvency Framework</h2>
<p>Both Parliamentary Reports stressed the need for a cross-border insolvency framework to strengthen the IBC, 2016. However, progress on necessary amendments remains slow, and the regulatory environment remains inadequate.</p>
<h3>Jet Airways vs State Bank of India (2019)</h3>
<p>In this case, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) considered a "cross-border insolvency protocol," which remains an ad hoc solution for regulating cross-border insolvencies.</p>
<h2>The Need for Reform</h2>
<p>While protocols have addressed some individual cases, they remain temporary solutions. Experts argue that India needs to adopt the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency to create a structured, comprehensive framework.</p>
<h2>Reforming Communication Methods Between Indian and Foreign Courts</h2>
<p>The outdated communication methods between Indian and foreign courts need to be reformed. Adopting the Judicial Insolvency Network (JIN) Guidelines (2016) would modernize judicial coordination, enhance transparency, and improve efficiency in handling cross-border insolvency cases.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Reforms to India's insolvency framework are urgent to address cross-border insolvency challenges and foster global economic stability.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Section 60(5) of the IBC restricts civil courts from exercising jurisdiction over insolvency matters, but the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) lacks the power to recognize or enforce foreign judgments or proceedings. To address these issues and strengthen cross-border insolvency management, it is crucial to expand the NCLT's powers and adopt the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency.</p>
