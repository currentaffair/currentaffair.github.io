<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The issue of delays in appointing Information Commissioners (ICs) under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005 has gained significant attention, especially after the Supreme Court's strong criticism of the Centre and States for their inaction. The delay in these appointments has led to a backlog of thousands of pending cases, undermining the core objective of the RTI Act: to promote transparency, accountability, and good governance. This article examines the concerns regarding the implementation of the RTI Act, its key provisions, and the challenges posed by these delays.</p>
<h2>Concerns Regarding the RTI Act, 2005</h2>
<p>Delays in the appointment of Information Commissioners have had far-reaching consequences. As of 2024, the Central Information Commission (CIC) faces eight vacancies among its IC posts, with over 23,000 pending appeals filed by citizens. In several states, Information Commissions have been defunct since 2020, and some have ceased accepting RTI petitions altogether. This has led to dissatisfaction with the responses received from Public Information Officers (PIOs), with many citizens filing first appeals that remain unresolved due to the lack of functioning commissions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Concern:</strong> The delays in appointments severely hinder citizensâ€™ ability to exercise their right to information and access to justice under the RTI framework.</p>
</div>
<h3>Subordinate Rules and Lack of Transparency</h3>
<p>The implementation of the RTI Act varies significantly across different states due to the existence of different subordinate rules. For example, some states do not have online portals, while others have inconsistent registration processes, further complicating the RTI filing procedure. Additionally, there are concerns regarding the transparency of appointments to the positions of ICs, as many appointees come from bureaucratic backgrounds. This has raised questions about impartiality and fairness in the decision-making process.</p>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Legal Precedent:</strong> The Supreme Court, in the case of Anjali Bhardwaj and Ors v. Union of India (2019), emphasized the need for the appointment of individuals from diverse backgrounds to ensure greater impartiality in decision-making.</p>

<h3>Changes in Data Protection Laws</h3>
<p>The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act) has made significant amendments to the disclosure of personal data under the RTI Act. While the RTI Act allowed for the disclosure of personal data when there was a public interest, the DPDP Act imposes a blanket ban, shielding powerful public officials from accountability. This shift could limit the public's ability to scrutinize government actions and decision-making processes.</p>
<h2>Key Facts About the RTI Act, 2005</h2>
<h3>About the RTI Act</h3>
<p>The RTI Act was enacted in 2005 to empower citizens to access information from public authorities, thereby promoting transparency and accountability in governance. The Act applies to all levels of government, including central, state, and local authorities, and ensures that citizens have the right to request and receive information that is in the public domain.</p>
<h3>Origin of the RTI Act</h3>
<p>The RTI Act originated from a grassroots movement in the 1980s in Rajasthan, where villagers demanded greater accountability and access to government records. This movement later led to the enactment of the RTI Act, which has become a crucial tool for empowering citizens and promoting good governance.</p>

<h3>Exemptions</h3>
<p>Despite its broad reach, the RTI Act is subject to certain exemptions. The Official Secrets Act (OSA), 1923, allows bureaucrats to withhold information if it relates to official secrecy. Similarly, other laws, such as the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and the All India Services Conduct Rules, 1968, also provide grounds for restricting information under the RTI Act.</p>
<h2>What is the Central Information Commission?</h2>
<p>The Central Information Commission (CIC) is a statutory body established under the RTI Act, 2005. Its primary function is to ensure the effective implementation of the RTI Act and uphold the right to information. The CIC is composed of the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and up to 10 other Information Commissioners.</p>
<h3>Composition and Appointment</h3>
<p>The members of the CIC are appointed by the President of India based on the recommendations of a committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and a Union Cabinet Minister. The CIC is tasked with ensuring that the RTI Act is followed properly and that citizens' requests for information are addressed promptly.</p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>In light of the challenges outlined, there is an urgent need to expedite the process of appointing Information Commissioners to fill vacancies and address the backlog of cases. It is also essential to broaden the selection criteria to include professionals from diverse fields, as recommended by the Supreme Court. Additionally, expanding the scope of the RTI Act to include public-private partnerships, sports bodies, and cooperatives, as well as bringing political parties under its purview, would ensure greater transparency, especially in financial matters.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The delay in the appointment of Information Commissioners has significant implications for citizens' right to information. To maintain the integrity of the RTI framework, it is essential to address these delays promptly and ensure that the RTI Act is implemented consistently and effectively across the country.</p>
