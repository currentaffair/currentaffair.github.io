<h1>Geopolitical Ramifications and Publisher-Platform Relations</h1>
</header>
<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Last month, The Australia Today’s coverage of External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s visit was discussed less for its substance and more for being inaccessible on Facebook in Canada. Coming on the back of diplomatic tensions between India and Canada, were Mr. Jaishankar’s interview and joint press conference, covered in The Australia Today, inaccessible in Canada due to a nudge by the Trudeau government? Or was it part of Meta’s strategy to block news on social media platforms in Canada?</p>

<section>
<h2>Canada’s Approach and Geopolitical Ramifications</h2>
<p>Some argue that this is a casualty of Canada’s approach to mitigate asymmetries between all-pervasive platforms, such as Facebook and Google, and news publishers, such as The Australia Today. The blackout has less to do with the politics of foreign policy and more to do with the politics of Meta’s corporate strategy. Mostly, it has to do with the geopolitical ramifications of developments in Canada’s media policy.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Symbiotic Relationship Between Platforms and Publishers</h2>
<p>Platforms facilitate publishers to reach a very large audience, and publishers offer platforms a stream of content to incessantly engage users. In this seemingly symbiotic relationship, only platforms know the true popularity of the news distributed to their users and therefore, the incremental advertising revenues trickling in from the content produced by publishers. Platforms are also known to change the metrics to gauge popularity and audience preference. These problems raise questions about transparency, accountability, and parity in the dealings between platforms and publishers.</p>
</section>
<section class="important">
<h2>Governing Frenemies: Canada’s Online News Act (ONA) and Bargaining Framework</h2>
<p>In June 2023, Canada devised a bargaining framework for platforms to duly remunerate news outlets. The resultant Online News Act (ONA) sought to protect publishers from losing income that is justifiably due to them from Meta and Alphabet. These platforms are legally obliged to fashion commercial agreements with one or a group of publishers. If either party disagrees, a bargaining process ensues with the involvement of a mediator.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Comparison with Australia’s Bargaining Code</h2>
<p>Canada was the second country to move on this matter, after the Australian initiative of 2021, known as the ‘Bargaining Code’. While concerns over the financial health of local news websites led to the enactment of the ONA, the Bargaining Code has been criticised for legitimising a mechanism that safeguards the interests of giants in the news business. After initial opposition, Meta and Google negotiated deals with many, but not all, Australian news outlets.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Google and Meta’s Responses to the ONA</h2>
<p>In Canada, Google complied with the ONA by agreeing to pay publishers and journalist associations. Meta adopted a contrary route: from August 2023, it foreclosed news offerings on its platforms, Facebook and Instagram, in Canada. However, web pages of journalists can still be accessed on both platforms.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Meta’s Control Over News Websites</h2>
<p>Since the ONA does not define a news website, Meta decides which is a news site and which is an opinion or community site. For instance, Baaz, a Canada-based news outlet catering to the Punjabi and Sikh diaspora, was inaccessible for a while on Facebook and Instagram. After it switched to Substack, a subscription-based platform, and redefined itself as a ‘community page’, Baaz became visible on both platforms.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Interrupting Global Flows</h2>
<p>Following the uproar over Mr. Jaishankar’s interview, Meta maintained that it blocks news in Canada, irrespective of its geographical origins. However, the editor of The Australia Today pointed out that prior to the interview, the content of the site was visible, suggesting that Meta restricted the site around the time the interview was posted. Such experiences render Meta vulnerable to criticism of selective compliance with the ONA.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Geopolitical Ramifications of National Media Policy</h2>
<p>The unavailability of the Jaishankar interview on Facebook in Canada also uncorks the geopolitical ramifications of national media policy. Regulations in Australia, Canada, and Indonesia have tackled the imbalances between platforms and publishers, as seen in their respective news markets. Consequently, these regulations vary in normative considerations, policy priorities, and institutional design.</p>
</section>
<section class="important">
<h2>Australia’s News Bargaining Incentive (NBI) Policy</h2>
<p>Recently, Australia disincentivised platforms that refrain from, or do not renew, agreements with publishers. Its News Bargaining Incentive (NBI) policy proposes to penalise platforms harvesting revenue of $250 million and more and failing to finalise agreements. This is to ensure, inter alia, that Meta does not replay its Canadian strategy in Australia, since earlier this year, it had announced plans to discontinue paying news outlets there.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>India’s Efforts to Tackle Publisher-Platform Asymmetries</h2>
<p>India has been tackling publisher-platform asymmetries since 2022, with the Competition Commission inquiring into the conduct of platforms, following pleas by news associations. It is unclear whether these efforts factor in the geopolitical dimensions of the matter. If the policy paralysis continues, India’s news outlets will continue to be devoid of fair shares of online advertising revenues, and vulnerable to the whims of the Alphabet-Meta duopoly.</p>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, structural censorship, seen in the Jaishankar interview case, could recur. It will proliferate if Meta replicates its Canadian strategy in the U.K., South Africa, and Germany, where fair compensation regulations are being evolved. If so, interviews by Indian Ministers to news outlets in those countries will be inaccessible on Meta’s platforms there. Therefore, policy pundits must weigh in urgently on fair compensation.</p>
