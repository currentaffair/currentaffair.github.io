        Eradicating Manual Scavenging
    </header>
    <section>
        <img src="manual_scavenging_image.jpg" alt="Manual Scavenging">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Manual scavenging is a centuries-old practice that involves the handling and cleaning of human excreta manually, often under hazardous and inhumane conditions. Despite legal bans, this practice continues in parts of India, particularly affecting marginalized communities. In this article, we will explore the challenges, legal frameworks, government initiatives, and way forward in eradicating manual scavenging.</p>

        <h3>Why in the News?</h3>
        <p>The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently organized a discussion on the rights and dignity of manual scavengers, focusing on the violations they face and the measures needed to eradicate this practice.</p>

        <h2>What is Manual Scavenging?</h2>
        <p>Manual scavenging involves the physical removal of human excreta, commonly from insanitary toilets, open drains, pits, or railway tracks. It is a deeply entrenched socio-economic issue that involves caste-based discrimination, and primarily impacts women and low-income groups.</p>

        <h3>Current Status</h3>
        <p>In 2021, India recorded 58,098 manual scavengers, with 75% of them being women. As of July 2024, 732 out of 766 districts in India have declared themselves free from manual scavenging.</p>

        <h2>Legal Framework and Rights Violations</h2>
        <p>Manual scavenging violates several fundamental rights, including the abolition of untouchability (Article 17) and the right to life with dignity (Article 21). There are specific laws in place to prevent and address manual scavenging, including:</p>

        <h3>Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013</h3>
        <p>This Act prohibits manual scavenging and mandates the rehabilitation of individuals involved in this practice through skill development programs, financial assistance, and alternative employment opportunities.</p>

        <h3>SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989</h3>
        <p>This Act criminalizes the employment of scheduled castes in manual scavenging and is aimed at preventing discrimination based on caste.</p>

        <h2>Challenges Faced by Manual Scavengers</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Health Issues</h3>
            <p>Manual scavengers are exposed to dangerous diseases like Hepatitis, cholera, and tetanus due to direct contact with human waste. They are also at risk of asphyxiation from toxic gases found in septic tanks, leading to fatalities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Social Stigma and Economic Challenges</h3>
            <p>Manual scavengers are often ostracized due to caste-based discrimination. This stigma, combined with poor wages and lack of job security, perpetuates poverty and social exclusion.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Double Discrimination: Women Manual Scavengers</h3>
        <p>Women, who make up a significant proportion of manual scavengers, face additional challenges such as sexual harassment, inequality, and exploitation.</p>

        <h2>Supreme Court Guidelines on Manual Scavenging</h2>
        <p>In 2023, the Supreme Court issued specific guidelines to eliminate manual scavenging, which include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phased eradication of manual sewer cleaning.</li>
            <li>Provision of compensation and rehabilitation for sewage workers.</li>
            <li>Accountability for outsourced sanitation work.</li>
            <li>Transparency and monitoring of deaths, compensation, and rehabilitation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Government Initiatives to Curb Manual Scavenging</h2>
        <p>The Indian government has launched various initiatives aimed at eliminating manual scavenging, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge</li>
            <li>Swachhta Abhiyan App</li>
            <li>Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan</li>
            <li>NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem)</li>
            <li>Technological solutions like Bandicoot robots and Robo-Drain systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Way Forward</h2>
        <p>To fully eradicate manual scavenging, India must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expand mechanization in sanitation work.</li>
            <li>Implement health screenings and safety protocols for sanitation workers.</li>
            <li>Increase funding for innovative sanitation technologies.</li>
            <li>Empower women-led SHGs for sustainable livelihoods.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The road to eradicating manual scavenging in India requires a multi-faceted approach, involving legal reforms, technological advancements, and a societal shift in attitudes toward manual scavengers. The key to success lies in the concerted efforts of all stakeholders, including the government, civil society, and the affected communities themselves.</p>
