<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Karnataka High Court's recent judgment in the Brindavan Hydropower Private Limited Case, 2024, has drawn significant attention. The court struck down the Electricity (Promoting Renewable Energy Through Green Energy Open Access) Rules, 2022 (GEOA Rules, 2022), along with the Karnataka Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions for Green Energy Open Access) Regulations, 2022. This ruling has wide-reaching implications for India’s energy sector, particularly in the context of the regulatory balance between the Centre and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs).</p>
<h2>Background of the Case</h2>
<p>Hydroelectric companies challenged the validity of the GEOA Rules, 2022, asserting that the rules infringed upon the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (KERC) exclusive authority to frame rules under the Electricity Act, 2003. The Central Government, on the other hand, defended the rules, citing the need to meet international treaty obligations, such as those made at COP26 in Glasgow, 2021.</p>
<h3>Key Points in the Judgment</h3>
<p>The Karnataka High Court ruled that the Central Government did not have the authority under the Electricity Act, 2003, to frame such rules. The judgment emphasized that powers to regulate open access and tariff determination must remain with State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, as provided under the Act.</p>
<h2>Analysis of the Electricity Act, 2003</h2>
<p>The Electricity Act, 2003, divides the regulatory functions between the Centre and State authorities. The Central Government has powers under Section 176(1) to make rules for the implementation of the Act. However, Section 42(2) and Section 181 of the Act make it clear that the responsibility for open access and regulatory actions related to tariffs lies with the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. The Court’s ruling reaffirmed this legal structure, rejecting the Central Government’s overreach through GEOA Rules, 2022.</p>
<h2>GEOA Rules, 2022 and Its Features</h2>
<p>The GEOA Rules, 2022 were formulated to accelerate India’s renewable energy targets and promote green energy through open access. Under these rules, consumers were empowered to procure renewable energy from other suppliers, bypassing the traditional distribution licensee in their area. The rules aimed to make renewable energy accessible to smaller consumers by lowering the threshold for open access from 1 MW to 100 kW.</p>
<h3>Salient Features of GEOA Rules, 2022</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green Energy Promotion:</strong> Encourages generation, purchase, and consumption of renewable energy.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Threshold:</strong> Open access limit reduced from 1 MW to 100 kW.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Demand Green Power:</strong> Consumers can request green power from Discoms.</li>
<li><strong>Uniform Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO):</strong> Applies to all obligated entities, including Green Hydrogen and Green Ammonia.</li>
<li><strong>Green Certificates:</strong> Consumers receive certificates for using green energy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>India’s Power Sector Status and Reforms</h2>
<p>India remains one of the largest electricity consumers globally. In FY23, power consumption grew by 9.5%. The Government is working to reduce the aggregate technical and commercial (AT&amp;C) losses to 12-15% by 2024-25 through schemes like the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS).</p>

<h2>India’s Updated NDC Targets</h2>
<p>At the COP26 Summit in 2021, India made a series of ambitious climate action pledges, aiming for a net-zero target by 2070. These commitments align with India’s ongoing efforts to enhance its renewable energy capacity and reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Karnataka High Court's decision emphasizes the importance of preserving the autonomy of State Regulatory Commissions in the regulation of open access and tariff determination. It highlights the ongoing balance between central and state-level governance in India's energy sector, underscoring the critical role of regulatory frameworks in achieving sustainable and reliable power distribution.</p>
