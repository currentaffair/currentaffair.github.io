<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, was a landmark piece of legislation aimed at ensuring transparency and accountability in government functioning. It allowed citizens to request information from public authorities, thereby promoting openness. However, the implementation of the RTI Act has faced numerous challenges. Despite its importance, the Act has been gradually undermined by various amendments, administrative delays, and inefficiencies, affecting its effectiveness in promoting transparency.</p>
<h2>Vacancies in Information Commissions</h2>
<p>One of the primary issues affecting the functioning of the RTI Act is the vacancies in the Information Commissions. The Central Information Commission (CIC), which plays a critical role in ensuring compliance with the RTI Act, currently has eight vacant posts of Information Commissioners. Furthermore, 23,000 appeals are pending before the CIC, resulting in significant delays. Several State Information Commissions are also nearly defunct due to a lack of members, compounding the problem.</p>
<h3>Impact of Vacancies</h3>
<p>The vacancies in Information Commissions have led to substantial delays in processing appeals and requests for information. Citizens are increasingly discouraged from seeking information due to the prolonged waiting times. This undermines the purpose of the RTI Act, which was designed to make government functioning more accessible and accountable to the public.</p>
<h2>Dilution of Autonomy</h2>
<p>Another key issue has been the dilution of the autonomy of Information Commissions. In 2019, the government amended the RTI Act, removing the fixed five-year tenure for Information Commissioners, thereby reducing the independence of the Central Information Commission (CIC). This change has made the CIC more susceptible to political pressures, which could influence decisions and appointments.</p>
<h3>Opaque Appointment Process</h3>
<p>The appointment process for Information Commissioners has also been a major source of concern. The government has been criticized for appointing retired civil servants instead of individuals from diverse professional backgrounds, such as journalists, social activists, or lawyers. This lack of diversity in the Commission reduces the credibility and effectiveness of the RTI Act.</p>

<h2>Supreme Court’s Intervention</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court has intervened in this matter by issuing directives to both the Centre and state governments. The Court has mandated that the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) provide a timeline for completing the selection process for Information Commissioners. Additionally, the search committee details and applicant lists must be made public to ensure transparency in appointments.</p>
<h3>State Governments’ Responsibility</h3>
<p>States that have already initiated the appointment process must complete it within a specific timeframe. The Court has emphasized the importance of proactive measures to prevent future vacancies, ensuring that Information Commissions remain functional.</p>
<h2>Consequences of Weakening the RTI Act</h2>
<p>Weakening the RTI Act has far-reaching consequences for governance and democracy. Delays in providing information shield government officials from scrutiny, leading to reduced accountability. Furthermore, citizens lose trust in the system when they face prolonged delays or denials of information. Ultimately, this diminishes the efficacy of the RTI Act as a tool for citizen empowerment and participatory democracy.</p>
<h2>Solutions and Way Forward</h2>
<h3>Timely Appointments and Proactive Measures</h3>
<p>To address the issue of vacancies, the government must comply with the 2019 Supreme Court judgment and advertise vacancies early to ensure timely appointments. It is also crucial to restore a fixed tenure for Information Commissioners to protect the autonomy of the Information Commissions.</p>
<h3>Diversifying Appointments</h3>
<p>The appointments to Information Commissions should be more diverse, incorporating individuals from various professional backgrounds such as journalism, law, and social activism. This will enhance the credibility and independence of the commissions, making them more effective in carrying out their duties.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the CIC and State Commissions</h3>
<p>It is essential to allocate adequate resources to the CIC and State Commissions to reduce the backlog of appeals. Additionally, the appeal process can be made more efficient by integrating technology to expedite resolutions.</p>
<h3>Ensuring Transparency in the Appointment Process</h3>
<p>To prevent favoritism and ensure fairness, the search committee process should be made public, and citizen oversight must be encouraged. Furthermore, accountability mechanisms must be implemented to monitor delays and ensure compliance with the RTI Act.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Right to Information Act, 2005, remains a vital tool for promoting transparency and accountability in governance. However, to fully realize its potential, urgent reforms are necessary. Timely appointments, greater diversity in the appointment process, and the restoration of autonomy to the Information Commissions are essential steps towards strengthening the RTI Act and restoring citizens' trust in government transparency.</p>
