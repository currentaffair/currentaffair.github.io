    Eradicating Manual Scavenging
</header>

<section>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Manual Scavenging Image">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Manual scavenging remains a critical issue that continues to plague various communities, especially in India.
        This practice involves the physically demanding and dangerous task of manually cleaning human excreta from insanitary toilets, drains, pits, and railway tracks. Despite legal efforts and technological advancements, manual scavenging is still prevalent in parts of the country, particularly affecting the marginalized communities. 
    </p>

    <h2>Current Status and Statistics</h2>
    <p>
        According to recent data from 2021, there were 58,098 manual scavengers in India, with women comprising a staggering 75% of the workforce. The practice, however, is being eradicated progressively. As of July 31st, 2024, 732 of the 766 districts in the country reported themselves as manual scavenging-free.
    </p>

    <h2>Violation of Fundamental Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Manual scavenging violates the fundamental rights guaranteed under India's Constitution. It breaches Article 17 (Abolition of Untouchability) and Article 21 (Right to Life with Dignity), as it perpetuates inhuman and degrading treatment of individuals performing this task.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal Framework and Government Initiatives</h2>
    <p>
        The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prohibits manual scavenging and the construction of insanitary latrines. It mandates the rehabilitation of manual scavengers by providing skill development, financial assistance, and alternative employment. Additionally, the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act criminalizes the employment of scheduled castes in manual scavenging.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges Faced by Manual Scavengers</h2>
    <h3>Health and Safety Risks</h3>
    <p>
        Manual scavengers are exposed to serious health risks due to direct contact with human waste. They are prone to diseases such as Hepatitis, Cholera, and Tetanus. Hazardous gases such as hydrogen sulfide in septic tanks present the danger of asphyxiation, sometimes leading to sudden death. Between 2019 and 2023, government records show that 377 individuals lost their lives while cleaning sewers and septic tanks.
    </p>

    <h3>Social Stigma and Economic Exploitation</h3>
    <p>
        The practice is deeply rooted in caste discrimination and social exclusion. Manual scavengers are often stigmatized as "untouchables" and face economic exploitation with low wages, typically below the minimum wage, and poor working conditions. Many are employed on a daily-wage basis, with little or no job security.
    </p>

    <h3>Double Discrimination for Women</h3>
    <p>
        Women manual scavengers face the dual burden of caste discrimination and gender inequality. They often encounter sexual harassment, exploitation, and violence in their daily lives.
    </p>

    <h3>Mental Health and Substance Abuse</h3>
    <p>
        The pervasive stigma associated with manual scavenging often leads to severe psychological issues, including anxiety and depression. To cope with their stressful lives, many scavengers turn to substance abuse, which compounds their physical and mental health issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Supreme Court Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        In 2023, the Supreme Court of India issued directions to eradicate manual scavenging, including the rehabilitation of workers and providing compensation for deaths and disabilities. These measures emphasize the need for accountability, transparency, and an improved framework to protect workers' rights.
    </p>

    <h2>Technological and Policy Innovations</h2>
    <h3>Technological Advancements</h3>
    <p>
        Technological initiatives such as the Bandicoot Robot, Robo-Drain Systems, and Vacuum Trucks have made a significant impact in reducing manual intervention in sanitation work. These innovations autonomously or remotely perform tasks such as cleaning sewer lines, detecting water contamination, and mitigating sewer blockages.
    </p>

    <h3>Government Programs</h3>
    <p>
        Several initiatives such as the Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge, Swachh Bharat Mission, and National Commission for Safai Karamchari have been launched to promote the mechanization of sanitation work and improve the conditions of manual scavengers.
    </p>

    <h2>Way Forward</h2>
    <p>
        While technological innovations and legal frameworks are crucial, the key to eradicating manual scavenging lies in greater mechanization, improved occupational health and safety standards, and comprehensive capacity building for workers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="highlight">
        Eradicating manual scavenging requires a multifaceted approach, including legal enforcement, technological innovation, and social awareness. It is imperative to focus on improving the living conditions of sanitation workers, ensuring their safety, and empowering them with skills and alternative employment opportunities.
