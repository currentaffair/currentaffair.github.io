<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The competitive disruptions of Parliament by both the Opposition and, more surprisingly, the Treasury benches, made the recently-concluded winter session of the legislature a travesty. There were more adjournments than discussions, hardly any work was done, and the session was adjourned with the widespread sentiment that we had let down the people of India. A new nadir was plumbed when duelling demonstrations by Members of Parliament (MP) on the steps of the House led to accusations of assault and injury on both sides. For many of us who were brought up to regard Parliament as the temple of our democracy, its precincts as hallowed, and its procedures and conventions as sacred, this seems a betrayal of everything the institution is supposed to represent as a cornerstone of our democracy.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Why Have Things Come to Such a Sorry State?</h2>
<h3>Precedent and Tradition</h3>
<p>One obvious reason (as in everything to do with Parliament) is precedent. The recent demise of the distinguished director, Shyam Benegal, reminded me of the time when he and I both served, as private citizens in 2007, on a round table of eminent Indians invited by then-Speaker Somnath Chatterjee to advise him in the performance of his duties. Our group, which included N.R. Narayana Murthy of 70-hour workweek fame, unanimously called for strict enforcement of the rules to ensure higher standards of decorum and debate. However, we were promptly disabused by the Speaker of our illusions. Disruptions, he said, occurred because an outnumbered Opposition saw them as part of their democratic rights. To thwart them by invoking the rule book would be condemned by all parties, including the ruling party, as undemocratic. So suspending, let alone expelling, MPs was not an option he could easily exercise.</p>
<h3>Part of Convention: Decline of Civility</h3>
<p>Whatever the merits of parliamentary protest — and personally, it is not something I have ever cared for — it has become part of the convention of Indian parliamentary practice. Speakers of the Lok Sabha, like Meira Kumar, whose decency was shamefully abused by a belligerent Bharatiya Janata Party, still averred that it would be wrong to expel unruly Opposition members without an all-party consensus on doing so. Though Speakers like Sumitra Mahajan and Om Birla have proved more willing to suspend members, they have usually preferred adjournment to expulsion.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Acrimony Between Government and Opposition</h2>
<p>A second factor is the acrimony that now prevails between the government and the Opposition. Traditionally, a sense of civility has always reigned in Indian politics: Atal Bihari Vajpayee loved telling the stories of Jawaharlal Nehru’s courtesy to him as a young firebrand Opposition leader. However, today, such episodes are inconceivable. Each side sees itself as the embodiment of righteous virtue, and the other as irredeemable evil. To the ruling party, the Opposition is 'anti-national.' The Opposition imagines themselves as outnumbered Pandavas facing the unfair might of the Kauravas in power.</p>
<p>Democracy requires both sides to accept, as a presumption, the good faith of the other; that disagreements are about how to achieve the best interests of the nation. In Indian politics today, government and Opposition see each other as enemies, not mere adversaries, which makes common ground hard to find.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The Breakdown of the Relationship of Trust</h2>
<p>It is sad that our national politics has witnessed such a breakdown in the relationship of trust that ought to exist between the government and the Opposition in any democracy. Both sides are equally guilty: The present ruling party was just as bad when it was in Opposition. The very BJP politicians who had argued for disruption, justifying obstructing Parliament for the higher principle of accountability, now condemn disruption. The Opposition, once victims of disruption, now adopts the same approach. The new golden rule of Indian politics has become: "Do unto them what they did unto you."</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The Public’s New Criteria for Judging Representatives</h2>
<p>The public no longer judges their representatives by their performance in Parliament but by the constituent services they render or the local political weight they command. Gone are the days when skilled debaters and orators held sway on the floor of the legislature, winning public adulation. Today, most representatives are judged by their ability to secure electoral victories and influence public opinion rather than their contributions to meaningful legislative debates.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Disruption and Contempt</h2>
<p>Parliamentary standards have been in free fall for a generation. Most MPs have limited interest in legislation and prefer to disrupt the proceedings rather than engage in effective debate. Meanwhile, the BJP government refuses to reach out to the Opposition and is content to steamroll several Bills through Parliament, treating it as a rubber stamp rather than a consultative body in a deliberative democracy.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The diminishing of Parliament in our political life is deeply damaging to our democracy. Sadly, its custodians are allowing it to be robbed of all value, to the point where the public will not miss it when it is gone.</p>
