<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
            As global trade tensions rise and automation transforms manufacturing, emerging economies like India stand at a crucial juncture in their development. The traditional path of export-led manufacturing growth, which helped countries like China achieve middle-income status, is now facing increasing challenges. The rise of protectionist barriers in developed nations presents a significant hurdle, especially for countries like India that have a strong services export sector but are still striving to grow their manufacturing base. 
        </p>
<h3>What Factors Are Driving the Rise of Protectionism?</h3>
<p>
            The shift towards protectionism in a globalized world is driven by several key factors:
        </p>
<section class="highlight">
<h3>Economic Nationalism and Deindustrialization</h3>
<p>
                The loss of manufacturing jobs in developed nations has led to a rise in economic nationalism. For instance, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 to subsidize domestic green technology production. Similarly, the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act (2023) aims to reduce reliance on imports for clean energy technologies.
            </p>
</section>
<h3>Geopolitical Rivalries and Strategic Decoupling</h3>
<p>
            Major powers, particularly the U.S. and China, are engaging in economic decoupling, prioritizing self-reliance in critical industries. In 2023, the U.S. restricted China's access to advanced semiconductor technology, while China retaliated by restricting exports of critical raw materials for chip manufacturing.
        </p>
<h3>Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Exposed by COVID-19</h3>
<p>
            The pandemic highlighted the over-dependence on global supply chains. During 2020, global trade in medical supplies saw disruptions. Countries like India imposed export bans on key products like ventilators, exposing vulnerabilities in the supply chain.
        </p>
<section class="important">
<h3>Rising Inequality and Populism</h3>
<p>
                Economic inequality and populism have driven demands for protectionist policies. The Brexit referendum in 2016, where voters blamed EU trade policies for local job losses, is an example of how populist leaders can exploit these grievances to justify tariffs and trade barriers.
            </p>
</section>
<h3>Environmental and Climate Concerns</h3>
<p>
            Environmental policies, under the guise of sustainability, are increasingly being used as protectionist tools. The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) imposes tariffs on imports with higher carbon footprints, which could impact industries in developing countries, including India.
        </p>
<h3>Technological Dominance and Digital Protectionism</h3>
<p>
            As nations compete for technological supremacy, countries like India have enacted data localization laws to protect their digital ecosystems. The EU’s Digital Services Act (2022) is another example of regulating the digital space to protect domestic firms.
        </p>
<h3>Protection of Domestic Agriculture</h3>
<p>
            Agricultural subsidies and tariffs, like those under the U.S. Farm Act of 2018, help shield domestic farmers from global market fluctuations. India has invoked similar protections to defend its farmers from external pressures.
        </p>
<h3>Inflationary Pressures and Economic Instability</h3>
<p>
            Rising inflation globally has led governments to impose export bans and import restrictions to stabilize domestic prices. For example, Indonesia banned palm oil exports in 2022 to control local cooking oil prices, affecting global markets.
        </p>
<h3>Weakening Multilateral Institutions</h3>
<p>
            The decline of multilateral trade institutions, such as the WTO, has prompted nations to resort to unilateral protectionist measures. The WTO's Appellate Body has been non-functional since 2019, leading to more bilateral trade agreements.
        </p>
<h3>Domestic Political Pressures</h3>
<p>
            Protectionist policies are often influenced by short-term political considerations, such as elections. The 2024 U.S. presidential race saw both major parties advocating for stricter tariffs.
        </p>
<h2>Challenges India Faces from Protectionism</h2>
<p>
            India’s growing integration into the global economy faces significant hurdles due to protectionism, particularly in sectors like textiles and clean energy. The imposition of tariffs and domestic subsidies in developed nations has put Indian exports at a disadvantage.
        </p>
<h3>Export Competitiveness and Market Access</h3>
<p>
            India's merchandise exports for 2023 amounted to $432 billion, a 5% decrease compared to 2022. Protectionist policies in key markets have made Indian goods less competitive, especially in sectors like textiles and clean energy.
        </p>
<h3>Disruption in Supply Chains</h3>
<p>
            The US-China semiconductor tensions have disrupted India’s electronics and EV industries. India imported over $12 billion worth of electronic components from China in 2023, and any disruptions in this supply chain could affect its $10 billion semiconductor mission.
        </p>
<h3>Impact on Domestic MSMEs</h3>
<p>
            Protectionism in developed markets impacts India’s MSMEs by reducing demand for their products, harming both exports and employment. The EU’s CBAM is set to impact India’s steel and cement industries.
        </p>
<h3>Inflationary Pressures from Import Barriers</h3>
<p>
            Export bans and import restrictions on key goods, such as palm oil and fertilizers, have led to inflationary pressures in India, affecting both consumers and agricultural productivity.
        </p>
<h3>Reduced FDI Inflows</h3>
<p>
            Protectionism has discouraged foreign investments, with FDI inflows to India falling by 43% in 2023, totaling $28 billion.
        </p>
<h3>Diversion of Resources to Trade Disputes</h3>
<p>
            Protectionism forces India to focus more on managing trade disputes, like the arbitration proceedings against Australia, instead of fostering new trade relationships.
        </p>
<h2>Is India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat a Form of Protectionism?</h2>
<p>
            Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) aims to reduce dependency on imports by promoting domestic industries. While critics argue it encourages protectionist measures, others view it as a strategic move to strengthen India’s global competitiveness.
        </p>
<h3>Arguments for Protectionism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased tariffs on imports, such as electronics and solar panels.</li>
<li>The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to encourage domestic manufacturing.</li>
<li>Withdrawal from Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Arguments Against Protectionism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus on global competitiveness, as shown by India’s mobile exports reaching ₹90,000 crore in FY 2023.</li>
<li>Strategic resilience rather than isolation in critical sectors like semiconductors and defense.</li>
<li>Selective liberalization in trade agreements with countries like Australia and the UAE.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<section class="conclusion">
            India’s response to rising protectionism, especially through initiatives like Atmanirbhar Bharat, presents a delicate balance between self-reliance and global integration. By adopting selective liberalization, strengthening infrastructure, and pursuing strategic partnerships, India can navigate the challenges posed by protectionism while positioning itself as a competitive player in the global economy.
