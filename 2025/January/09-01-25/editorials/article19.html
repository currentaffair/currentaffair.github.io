<h1>India's Rising Burden of Non-Communicable Diseases and the Importance of Preventive Healthcare</h1>
</header>
<section>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>India is facing a healthcare crisis that is growing both in scope and cost. We face an alarming dichotomy today: while life expectancy of Indians is expected to increase further, many are facing disease burden earlier. As the country sees an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, the financial burden on individuals and the healthcare system continues to escalate.</p>
<h2>Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in India</h2>
<h3>Rise in NCD-related Deaths</h3>
<p>NCDs accounted for about 65% of all deaths in 2022, up from about 50% in 2010-13, as per the National Family Health Survey-5.</p>
<h3>Prevalence of Risk Factors</h3>
<p>The prevalence of risk factors for NCDs is worryingly high:</p>
<ul>
<li>One in four adult men are hypertensive.</li>
<li>One in eight are diabetic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Increase in Cancer Cases</h3>
<p>Further, breast, lung, and cervical cancer are on the rise, with the median age of diagnosis occurring earlier than global averages.</p>
<h3>Impact of Early Diagnosis</h3>
<p>Millions of people facing these conditions could have been managed better, at often lower costs, had they been diagnosed earlier.</p>
<h3>Shifting Focus to Prevention</h3>
<p>Shifting the focus from reactive treatment to proactive prevention is crucial, not only to improve health outcomes but also to control the ever-increasing healthcare expenses.</p>
<h2>A Growing Economic Burden</h2>
<h3>Health Budget Allocation</h3>
<p>The Union Budget for 2024 allocated ₹87,657 crore to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, marking a 13% increase from the previous year. However, experts agree that the allocation remains insufficient given the scale of India’s health challenges.</p>
<h3>Total Health Expenditure</h3>
<p>The National Health Accounts show the total current health expenditure estimate in 2021-22 as ₹7.9 lakh crore, growing at a rate more than overall inflation.</p>
<h2>Economic Burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that the economic burden of NCDs in India will surpass ₹280 lakh crore by 2030, equivalent to ₹2 lakh per household. This escalating cost poses a severe threat to financial stability, particularly for middle and lower-income families.</p>
<h2>The Role of Preventive Healthcare</h2>
<h3>Impact of Regular Screenings</h3>
<p>Regular screenings, especially for high-risk individuals, could significantly reduce the incidence of serious, life-threatening and debilitating conditions and their resultant cascading economic and social effects.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>In a large hospital network, for every 1,000 people screened, at least three people are identified for pre-emptive cardiac or cancer interventions.</p>
</div>
<h3>Targeted Screening Investigations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mammograms for breast cancer.</li>
<li>Pap smears for cervical cancer.</li>
<li>X-ray or low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer.</li>
<li>Ultrasound for liver disease.</li>
<li>Echocardiography and treadmill stress test for heart disease.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cost of Comprehensive Health Checks</h3>
<p>Comprehensive health checks, which can cost anywhere between ₹8,000 and ₹15,000 in metro cities today, are perceived as expensive.</p>
<h2>Policy Recommendations for Preventive Healthcare</h2>
<h3>Government's Role in Preventive Healthcare</h3>
<p>If the government were to enable a step change in preventive health services adoption, it could significantly reduce the overall financial burden on individuals and the healthcare system.</p>
<h3>Revised Tax Deduction Limit</h3>
<p>It would be prudent for policymakers to consider revising the tax deduction limit to at least ₹15,000 in the Union Budget for 2025-26. This would incentivise more individuals to undergo preventive health checks, potentially saving the nation several thousand crores in future healthcare costs.</p>
<h2>The Path Forward</h2>
<h3>Strengthening Early Intervention Capabilities</h3>
<p>First, we need to strengthen early intervention capabilities through the Ayushman Health and Wellness Centres, including capturing trends effectively and enabling risk-driven targeted screening using AI-enabled imaging modalities.</p>
<h3>Improving Screening Adoption at Private Centres</h3>
<p>Second, we need to improve the adoption of screening at private centres by encouraging insurers and private health providers to offer a subsidised minimum screening programme for every individual between 40-60 years.</p>
<h3>Increasing Tax Deduction Limit</h3>
<p>Finally, the increase in tax deduction limit can further incentivise people to complete comprehensive health checks.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<p>In conclusion, India's rising burden of non-communicable diseases demands urgent attention. By focusing on preventive care, implementing early interventions, and incentivizing regular screenings, we can reduce the financial strain on individuals and the healthcare system.</p>
