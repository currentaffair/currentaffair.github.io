<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Manual scavenging refers to the practice of physically handling or cleaning human excreta by individuals, often in hazardous and insanitary conditions. This practice primarily involves cleaning human waste from toilets, open drains, pits, or railway tracks without protective equipment. Despite being outlawed, manual scavenging continues in parts of India, significantly impacting the dignity and lives of those involved, mostly from marginalized communities.</p>
<h2>Current Status of Manual Scavenging</h2>
<p>In 2021, there were 58,098 recorded manual scavengers in India, with a staggering 75% being women. However, by mid-2024, 732 out of the 766 districts in India reported themselves as manual scavenging-free. This progress, though commendable, is far from total eradication.</p>
<h2>Violation of Fundamental Rights</h2>
<p>The practice of manual scavenging violates several fundamental rights, particularly Article 17, which prohibits untouchability, and Article 21, which guarantees the right to life with dignity. The ongoing practice has led to a continued denial of basic human rights for the individuals involved, who often face discrimination, poor living conditions, and lack of access to essential services.</p>
<h2>Legal Framework Against Manual Scavenging</h2>
<h3>Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013</h3>
<p>This Act prohibits the practice of manual scavenging and mandates the conversion of insanitary toilets into sanitary ones. It also provides for the identification and rehabilitation of manual scavengers, offering skill development and alternative employment opportunities.</p>
<h3>SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989</h3>
<p>This Act criminalizes the employment of scheduled castes in manual scavenging, aiming to reduce the social stigma and discrimination associated with the profession.</p>
<h2>Challenges Faced by Manual Scavengers</h2>
<h3>Health Risks</h3>
<p>Manual scavengers are exposed to dangerous pathogens, leading to diseases such as hepatitis, tetanus, and cholera. Additionally, gases like hydrogen sulfide in septic tanks pose a serious risk of asphyxiation, resulting in sudden deaths. Between 2019 and 2023, 377 individuals died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks.</p>
<h3>Social and Economic Stigma</h3>
<p>Social stigma and caste-based discrimination continue to plague manual scavengers, exacerbating their marginalization. Women, in particular, face double discrimination, both as women and as members of lower castes, subjecting them to sexual harassment and exploitation. The work is poorly paid, with most scavengers earning below the minimum wage and working without job security.</p>
<h3>Psychological Impact</h3>
<p>The emotional toll of manual scavenging can lead to mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. These workers are often trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and social exclusion, with little hope for a better life.</p>
<h2>Supreme Courtâ€™s Guideline on Manual Scavenging</h2>
<p>In 2023, the Supreme Court issued 14 guidelines for the complete eradication of manual scavenging, focusing on rehabilitation, compensation for workers, and the introduction of mechanized cleaning methods. This includes providing compensation for the families of workers who die in the line of duty and implementing accountability for contractors who exploit manual scavengers.</p>
<h2>Government Initiatives</h2>
<p>The Indian government has launched several initiatives to eradicate manual scavenging, such as the Swachh Bharat Mission and Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge. These initiatives focus on mechanization, awareness, and financial support for sanitation workers. The government has also introduced technological advancements like the Bandicoot Robot and vacuum trucks to reduce human involvement in hazardous sanitation work.</p>
<h2>Technological Solutions for Manual Scavenging</h2>
<p>Advancements in technology have the potential to transform sanitation work. Machines such as the Bandicoot robot autonomously clean sewers, while vacuum trucks remove waste without human entry. These technologies reduce the risks faced by manual scavengers and offer a safer, more sustainable alternative.</p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>The path to eradicating manual scavenging involves scaling up mechanization, ensuring safety for sanitation workers, and providing rehabilitation and compensation. There is a need to empower workers with skills, offer financial assistance for technological innovations, and improve policies to ensure sustainable livelihoods for marginalized communities.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Eradicating manual scavenging is not just a matter of legality but one of human dignity. While progress has been made, continued efforts are necessary to ensure the complete abolition of this degrading practice. A multi-faceted approach involving legal frameworks, technological advancements, and social empowerment is crucial to achieving this goal.</p>
