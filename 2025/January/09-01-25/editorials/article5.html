<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The climate conference in Baku in 2024 turned the climate treaty on its head by scrapping the defining feature of the post-colonial world divided between ‘donors’ and ‘recipients’ and suggesting the need for an alternate global sustainability forum. This shift requires that developing countries take charge of their own destiny.</p>
<h2>Purpose of the Climate Treaty in 1992</h2>
<p>The climate treaty of 1992 aimed to address the common concern of climate change by uniting nations to reduce emissions. However, in an unequal world, this was mainly defined by the G7 countries reducing future emissions of carbon dioxide, despite the treaty acknowledging that cumulative emissions alone matter.</p>
<h3>Imbalance in Responsibility</h3>
<p>Developing countries agreed to take on a problem they did not create in exchange for technology transfer and funds. However, the imbalance in research capacity and global priorities has set the stage for shifting the burden onto these countries.</p>
<h2>Backbone of the Current Arrangement</h2>
<p>The backbone of the current arrangement is the disconnect between academic treatment, rules, and practice, providing continuing advantages to the G7. Global concerns are often selected and defined in ways that prioritize the interests of the G7, dealing with symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of the problems.</p>
<h2>Shifting Responsibilities and Financial Support</h2>
<p>The G7 countries have now shifted away from their responsibility for climate change, with their financial support seen as an "optical illusion" by countries like India. The pressure to provide incentives for private finance and deal with trade restrictions was never part of the original "grand bargain."</p>
<h2>Two World Views</h2>
<p>The G7, the former colonial powers, have shifted their stance over time, assuming primary responsibility for climate change. However, the Global South now faces the challenge of sustainable development, recognizing the need to transition energy systems and lifestyles.</p>
<h3>Sustainable Development for the Global South</h3>
<p>The Global South represents a significant portion of the world’s population and GDP, and its path towards sustainability must not be modeled after the G7’s failed trajectory. The impact of climate change is most severe for the Global South, and growing calls for climate justice are emerging. Many countries, through their Nationally Determined Contributions, are explicitly including the concept of a "just transition," acknowledging the social dimensions of climate action.</p>
<h3>Understanding Climate Justice</h3>
<p>Climate justice is not simply about fairness in policy implementation. It questions the distinctions between local and global levels, and mitigation versus adaptation. Climate justice emphasizes the disproportionate emissions of the Global North and the solutions that exacerbate inequality, such as carbon pricing and trade restrictions.</p>
<h2>Conflicting Visions of Society and Progress</h2>
<p>The G7’s resource use and patterns of urbanization are not being followed by the Global South. By 2050, the G7 will account for 25% of global emissions despite only comprising 10% of the global population. The Global South is expected to account for a larger share of emissions, paralleling its population growth. This signals the urgent need for new principles of sustainability centered around justice.</p>
<h2>Global Governance</h2>
<p>With global cooperation in jeopardy, three initiatives are proposed: first, BRICS and partner countries should establish an alternate sustainability forum focused on urban energy transition; second, UN Climate negotiations should address G7 emissions reductions and grants to vulnerable countries; and third, international fora should serve as stocktaking sessions to help guide global decisions.</p>
<h3>The Role of BRICS</h3>
<p>BRICS countries, as key players in the new multilateralism, are expected to bridge the gap in global governance. This includes strengthening their position in global organizations like the UN Security Council and advocating for a more just climate system.</p>
<div class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The global climate policy must evolve to reflect the needs and rights of the Global South. The G7-dominated system is outdated, and a new approach is needed, led by BRICS, focusing on shared responsibility, equitable emissions reductions, and financial support for vulnerable nations. This approach is essential for sustainable global progress.</p>
