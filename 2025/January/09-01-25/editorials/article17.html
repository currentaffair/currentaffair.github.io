<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On December 25, 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Ken-Betwa River Link Project, aimed at alleviating the water scarcity in the Bundelkhand region spanning Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. This project plans to connect the water-surplus Ken river with the Betwa river, which has faced consistent drought. However, the project also raises environmental concerns, notably the construction of a dam within the Panna Tiger Reserve, which could result in its submergence.</p>
<h3>A Misplaced Model</h3>
<p>The project, estimated at a cost of ₹45,000 crore, has continued despite strong objections from experts, including members of an empowered committee appointed by the Supreme Court. Critics argue that the project circumvents the laws governing hydroelectric power projects and promotes geoengineering solutions like inter-basin water transfer as the panacea for India’s water crisis.</p>
<h3>Concept of Inter-Basin Transfer</h3>
<p>The concept of inter-basin water transfer dates back over 130 years, first proposed by Sir Arthur Cotton, who designed irrigation dams in the Godavari and Krishna river valleys. Over time, the idea was refined by M. Visvesvaraya, and later expanded by K.L. Rao and Captain Dinshaw J. Dastur. Initially referred to as the 'National Water Grid,' the plan has now evolved into the 'River-Interlinking Project' under the Ministry of Water Resources.</p>
<h3>National Water Development Agency (NWDA)</h3>
<p>Established in 1982, the NWDA has been responsible for surveying and investigating feasibility for linking rivers. The agency has identified 30 potential links, aiming to mitigate floods and droughts, boost rural income, and alleviate water distress in agriculture. The estimated cost of the project is ₹5.5 lakh crore, excluding social, environmental, and operational costs.</p>
<h3>Environmental Concerns</h3>
<p>Opponents of the project highlight its environmental implications, arguing that it overlooks the devastating impact on river ecosystems and deltaic regions. The uncontrolled manipulation of river systems could lead to irreversible ecological damage, ultimately harming society's long-term well-being.</p>
<h3>Climate Change Considerations</h3>
<p>The influence of climate change, particularly on rainfall patterns and river flows, further complicates the interlinking project. The project must consider how altered rainfall and river flow could exacerbate existing water scarcity issues, making the solution even more questionable.</p>
<h3>The Eco-Services of Rivers</h3>
<p>Rivers provide essential eco-services, such as flushing silt from riverbeds to maintain deltaic ecosystems. Diverting river water without accounting for these services risks destroying these natural functions, threatening biodiversity and the livelihoods of millions of people.</p>
<h3>Impact of Water Diversion on Deltaic Regions</h3>
<p>Diverting river water can deprive deltaic regions of the necessary freshwater to balance the effects of saltwater intrusion from the sea. Such changes lead to severe consequences for the ecosystems that depend on these water flows.</p>
<h3>Global Examples of River Channelization</h3>
<p>International case studies, such as the channelization of the Kissimmee River in Florida and the diversion of rivers feeding the Aral Sea, serve as cautionary tales. These projects, which aimed to control flooding or increase irrigation, have ultimately led to environmental disasters, resulting in the destruction of wetlands and the desiccation of lakes.</p>
<h3>The Real Reasons for India's Water Crisis</h3>
<p>India’s water crisis is primarily caused by poor water management, inadequate environmental practices, and systemic issues like corruption and ambiguous laws. It is critical to address these root causes before pursuing large-scale interventions like the river interlinking project.</p>
<h3>National Water Policy Recommendations</h3>
<p>A more holistic approach is necessary for addressing India’s water issues. Recommendations include better watershed management, local citizen involvement in monitoring water cycles, effective aquifer management, and engagement with farmers to improve irrigation practices. Additionally, a comprehensive interdisciplinary study of river basins is crucial before embarking on large-scale water transfer projects.</p>
<h3>International Example: Israel’s Success</h3>
<p>Israel’s innovative drip irrigation techniques offer valuable lessons for India. The country's efforts to modernize irrigation have helped save significant amounts of water, reduce the need for fertilizers and pesticides, and maintain aquifer health. Incorporating traditional methods alongside modern techniques can further enhance water management strategies.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Despite the current political regime's emphasis on the religious significance of India’s rivers, the river interlinking project contradicts the reverence espoused by these ideologies. Overexploited by dams, polluted by waste, and commodified for religious purposes, India’s rivers face a grave existential threat. Who will rise to protect them?</p>
