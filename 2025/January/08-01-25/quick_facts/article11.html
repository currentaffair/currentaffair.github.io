<h1>Student Enrollment Decline in India</h1>
<p>Student enrollment in India decreased by over 1 crore from 26.3 crore in 2018–19 to 24.8 crore in 2023–24. This decline is attributed to changes in data collection methodology and the elimination of duplicate enrollments.</p>
<h2>Change in Methodology</h2>
<p>Starting from 2022-23, the Ministry of Education (MoE) began collecting individual student data, including Aadhaar numbers. This methodology revealed that previous enrollment figures were overestimated by 5-6%.</p>
<h2>Reasons for Decline</h2>
<p>The sharp drop is largely due to the correction of inflated enrollment numbers, which included duplicate records and overestimated figures. MoE has not clarified the reasons for the significant dip in enrollment.</p>
<h2>Decline in Schools</h2>
<p>The number of schools under the UDISE+ system decreased by 87,012 from 2017-18 to 2023-24, primarily affecting government-run schools, especially in states like Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra.</p>
<h2>Impact of School Closures</h2>
<p>School closures, particularly in rural areas, have led to difficulties in re-admission for students, contributing to higher dropout rates. Distance and inconvenience are major barriers to re-admission.</p>
<h2>Effect on Funding</h2>
<p>The drop in enrollment raises concerns about the efficient use of funding, such as the ₹32,515 crore allocated under the Samagra Shiksha scheme in 2022-23, despite the enrollment decline.</p>
<h2>State-Specific Trends</h2>
<p>Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, and Uttar Pradesh faced the largest reductions in schools, with Jammu and Kashmir losing 4,509 schools. This has resulted in accessibility challenges for students.</p>
<h2>UDISe+ Data Caution</h2>
<p>The MoE has cautioned that UDISE+ data for 2022-23 and 2023-24 is not directly comparable to earlier years due to changes in data collection methodology, but key educational indicators like dropout and retention rates are still comparable.</p>
