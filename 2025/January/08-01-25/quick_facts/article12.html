<h1>Assam Coal Mine Rescue Operation</h1>
<p>On January 8, 2025, nine coal miners were trapped in a water-filled mine in Dima Hasao district, Assam. The authorities were notified around 2 p.m. on the same day.</p>
<h2>Rescue Efforts</h2>
<p>The Navy's deep divers joined the operation on January 9, 2025, due to the mine's complex tunnel system. Other agencies involved include the Army, Assam Rifles, NDRF, SDRF, and local police.</p>
<h2>Mine Conditions</h2>
<p>The mine has a radius of 20 feet and a depth of 300 feet. Water inside has risen to over 100 feet, complicating the rescue efforts. Three bodies have been seen but not recovered yet.</p>
<h2>Casualties and Arrests</h2>
<p>One individual, Punish Nunisa, was arrested under the Mines and Minerals Act for allegedly operating the mine illegally.</p>
<h2>Historical Context</h2>
<p>Mining accidents are frequent in the Northeast, including notable incidents in Nagaland, Assam, and Meghalaya.</p>
<h2>Investigation and Government Response</h2>
<p>The Assam Chief Minister confirmed the mine's illegal status. The government has called for more equipment and resources for the rescue operation, which is complicated by the mine's location in a remote jungle area.</p>
<h2>Challenges in Rescue Operations</h2>
<p>Due to the mineâ€™s location and high water levels, immediate action has been hindered, requiring careful and coordinated rescue strategies.</p>
