<h1>Maoist Activity and Security Updates</h1>
<p>Recent trends show a significant reduction in large-scale attacks by Maoists, with a notable exception in Bijapur (8 killed). Despite the drop in fatalities, the region remains a focal point for left-wing extremism.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<p>In 2024, Maoist casualties totaled 296, the third-highest since 2000. However, only 24 security personnel died, marking the second-lowest number in recent history. Bastar continues to be the epicenter of Maoist activity in Chhattisgarh, accounting for nearly 30% of related deaths between 2020-2025.</p>
<h2>Decline in Maoist Influence</h2>
<p>Maoist influence has sharply contracted due to tribal communities distancing themselves from insurgents. The 2023 Chhattisgarh elections reflected this shift, with a notable decline in NOTA votes. Other states, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Jharkhand, have seen a decrease in Maoist activity and fatalities.</p>
<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>While large-scale attacks have declined, the Maoists still retain the capacity for high-casualty incidents, especially in Bastar. Continued security efforts and addressing socio-political grievances are crucial to prevent further escalation.</p>
