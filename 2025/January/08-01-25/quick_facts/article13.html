<h1>Supreme Court Criticism on RTI Appointments</h1>
<p>The Supreme Court criticized the delay in appointing Information Commissioners, which hampers the effective functioning of the Right to Information (RTI) Act.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<p>The Central Information Commission has eight vacant posts, resulting in over 23,000 pending RTI appeals. Several state commissions have been defunct since 2020, and some no longer accept RTI petitions.</p>
<p>Justice Surya Kant questioned the purpose of transparency institutions if there are no personnel to enforce the law. He also expressed concern about the appointment of retired bureaucrats, limiting diversity.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court had issued previous judgments urging the diversification of Information Commissioners, but little progress was made. The Centre has been asked to file an affidavit detailing a timeline for filling vacancies.</p>
<p>The court's directives include clear timelines for appointments, publication of search committee composition, and compliance reports from Chief Secretaries.</p>
