<h1>Gang Violence in Haiti - 2024</h1>
<p>Over 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti in 2024, a sharp increase from the previous year, with over 1,000 more deaths than in 2023. Thousands more were injured or kidnapped, worsening the country's crisis.</p>
<h2>Key Events</h2>
<p>In December 2024, the Wharf Jeremie gang orchestrated a massacre in Cite Soleil, killing 207 people, mostly older individuals accused of voodoo practices. Victims were allegedly dismembered and burned. Human rights violations included 315 lynchings and 281 summary executions by specialized police units.</p>
<h2>Geographical Context</h2>
<p>Violent gangs control much of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, and political instability has been further exacerbated by these gang activities.</p>
<h2>International Response</h2>
<p>Despite a Kenyan-led police support mission, backed by the US and the UN, the violence continues unabated. Calls have been made for restoring the rule of law in Haiti and holding violators accountable.</p>
