        Supreme Court Calls for Legislative Reviews
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Recently, the Supreme Court (SC), while hearing a plea regarding the 45-day limitation under Section 81 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, emphasized the necessity of periodic legislative reviews to assess the effectiveness of laws. The Court highlighted the need for an expert mechanism to evaluate laws and identify deficiencies or bottlenecks, proposing reviews every 20, 25, or 50 years.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RPA 1951)</h2>
        <p>The Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RPA 1951) regulates the electoral system at both the national and state levels. This Act outlines the allocation of seats for the Lok Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, and State Legislative Councils. It also governs the delimitation of constituencies for elections and specifies qualifications and disqualifications for voters.</p>

        <h3>Key Provisions of RPA Act:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Act specifies the qualifications and disqualifications for voters.</li>
            <li>It provides the framework for the preparation of electoral rolls.</li>
            <li>Section 81 of the Act stipulates that election petitions challenging results must be filed within 45 days from the declaration of results, addressing issues such as illegal practices, corruption, or violations of electoral law.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Need for Periodic Legislative Reviews</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Identifying Deficiencies</h3>
            <p>Laws may lose relevance over time due to evolving circumstances, making regular reviews essential. For instance, the IT Act, 2000, was amended to address cybercrimes, an issue that wasn't as prevalent when the law was first enacted.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Ensuring Relevance of Legislation</h3>
            <p>Periodic reviews ensure laws remain effective, relevant, and aligned with societal needs. In some cases, laws may be hastily enacted or politically driven, leading to ineffective outcomes. For example, the Anti-liquor law in Bihar led to a surge in bail applications, burdening the judiciary, while Rajasthan's law on cow slaughter raised concerns about the misuse of power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Addressing Unintended Consequences</h3>
            <p>Regular reviews help identify areas where laws inadvertently hinder justice or create inefficiencies. Section 81's 45-day limit may prevent valid election disputes due to procedural constraints.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Improving Accountability</h3>
            <p>Regular reviews ensure laws align with their original objectives. Section 498A of the IPC, initially aimed at protecting women from cruelty, has faced criticism for misuse, underlining the importance of periodic revisions to prevent exploitation of legal provisions.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Global Standards</h3>
        <p>Many democratic nations conduct routine legislative reviews to ensure laws align with international best practices. The US PATRIOT Act, for example, has undergone revisions to address privacy and civil liberties concerns.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Periodic Revision of Laws in Other Democratic Countries</h2>

        <h3>United Kingdom</h3>
        <p>The Law Commission of England and Wales regularly reviews existing laws. Its recommendations have led to significant reforms, such as the repeal of the Witchcraft Act, 1735, showcasing its role in modernizing outdated laws.</p>

        <h3>Australia</h3>
        <p>The Australian Law Reform Commission systematically reviews the legal framework and submits reports with recommendations for legislative amendments, ensuring that laws remain relevant to contemporary issues.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Challenges in Periodically Reviewing Laws</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Lack of Political Will</h3>
            <p>Legislative reviews are sometimes influenced by political agendas, which can lead to biased amendments that serve electoral interests rather than public welfare. An example is the controversial Farm Laws (2020), criticized for favoring corporate interests over farmer concerns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Judicial Overreach</h3>
            <p>The judiciary's involvement in legislative reviews can sometimes be seen as overreach, as seen in the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) case, where the Supreme Court struck down an attempt to reform judicial appointments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Legal Complexity</h3>
            <p>Laws are often interdependent, and isolated amendments can lead to unintended conflicts with existing legislation, complicating the review process. For example, there have been anomalies in provisions related to child pornography under the POCSO Act and the IPC.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Limited Public Participation</h3>
            <p>Low public understanding of the legislative process can limit the impact of the review. The Ranbir Singh Committeeâ€™s limited public participation raised concerns about inclusivity in legal reforms.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Institutions Related to Legal Reform in India</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC)</li>
            <li>National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) chaired by Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah</li>
            <li>Committee for Reforms in Criminal Laws (2020) under Dr. Ranbir Singh</li>
            <li>Law Commission of India</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Way Forward</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Strengthening Law Commission of India</h3>
            <p>To enhance the quality and consistency of legal reforms, India must strengthen institutions like the Law Commission of India, providing them with greater independence and resources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Leveraging Technology</h3>
            <p>Technology, such as platforms like MyGov for public consultations and AI tools for evaluating the effectiveness of laws, can improve the efficiency and inclusivity of the review process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Resource Allocation</h3>
            <p>The government should allocate dedicated resources for legal reforms and capacity-building programs to improve the implementation of laws.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Engaging with International Best Practices</h3>
            <p>India should align its laws with international standards, particularly in environmental and technology governance, as exemplified by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Law Commission of India</h2>
        <p>The Law Commission of India is a non-statutory advisory body tasked with researching and recommending legal reforms. Established in 1955, it advises the government on legal matters and proposes new legislation and amendments to improve the legal system.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By institutionalizing periodic legislative reviews, India can foster a dynamic legal framework that remains responsive to societal needs, democratic ideals, and global standards. Judicial pronouncements and international practices will serve as guiding benchmarks in this ongoing endeavor.</p>
