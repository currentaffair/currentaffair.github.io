    10 Years of UJALA and SLNP
</header>
<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) scheme, launched on 5th January 2015, marks its 10th anniversary as a transformative initiative in energy efficiency. UJALA has revolutionized household lighting, reduced energy consumption, and contributed to India's environmental sustainability goals. Alongside, the Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP) was introduced to replace conventional streetlights with energy-efficient Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), further promoting energy efficiency.</p>
<h3>Key Facts About UJALA Scheme</h3>
<div class="highlight">
<p>The UJALA Scheme was launched in January 2015 with the goal of promoting energy efficiency by replacing traditional lighting systems like incandescent lamps (ICLs) and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) with energy-saving LED bulbs. It is a joint project between India's government, the Ministry of Power's Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), and Distribution Companies (DISCOMs).</p>
</div>
<h3>Objectives of UJALA</h3>
<p>The main objectives of the UJALA scheme include saving 85 lakh kWh of electricity and reducing 15,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions by replacing 77 crore traditional bulbs and 3.5 crore streetlights with LEDs. With the growing demand for electricity, the scheme plays a critical role in reducing energy consumption in households across India.</p>
<h3>Efficiency of LEDs</h3>
<p>LEDs save up to 90% energy compared to incandescent lamps and 50% compared to CFLs. They use 75% less energy and last 25 times longer than incandescent bulbs. Although the high upfront cost posed a barrier, the reduction in the cost of LEDs through UJALA made these energy-efficient lights accessible to many households.</p>
<h3>Key Features of UJALA</h3>
<div class="important">
<p>The UJALA Scheme offered subsidized LED bulbs, reducing their price to Rs 70 per LED bulb in comparison to Rs 450 in 2014. Through bulk procurement and the demand aggregation model, EESL worked with state governments to establish a distribution network, making LEDs affordable for all.</p>
</div>
<h3>Progress and Achievements</h3>
<p>Over the years, more than 36.87 crore LED bulbs have been distributed, resulting in substantial energy and cost savings, as well as CO2 reduction. Some key achievements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy Savings: 47,883 million kWh of energy saved annually.</li>
<li>Cost Savings: Rs. 19,153 crore saved annually.</li>
<li>CO2 Reduction: 3.88 million tonnes of CO2 avoided annually.</li>
<li>Peak Demand Avoided: 9,586 MW peak demand has been avoided.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GRAM UJALA Scheme</h3>
<p>In March 2021, the Gram UJALA scheme was introduced to offer LED bulbs at Rs. 10 each for rural households in exchange for old incandescent bulbs. The initiative targeted rural areas where energy efficiency was a pressing issue. By 2025, the scheme aims to distribute 1.5 crore bulbs, saving 2025 million kWh of energy annually and reducing CO2 emissions by 1.65 million tonnes per year.</p>
<h3>Key Facts About Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP)</h3>
<div class="highlight">
<p>The SLNP was launched to reduce energy consumption, lower operational costs for municipalities, and drive a market transformation towards energy-efficient appliances. It is implemented by EESL in collaboration with urban local bodies (ULBs), municipal bodies, and governments at various levels.</p>
</div>
<h3>Business Model of SLNP</h3>
<p>SLNP's unique business model involves EESL covering initial costs, which are recovered from municipalities through monthly or quarterly payments. EESL also ensures 95% uptime for LED streetlights, providing reliable service and enhancing public safety.</p>
<h3>Achievements of SLNP</h3>
<p>The SLNP has significantly contributed to the country’s sustainability goals by reducing energy consumption, operational costs, and the carbon footprint of street lighting systems across India.</p>

<h3>Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL)</h3>
<p>EESL, established in 2009, is a Super Energy Service Company that implements large-scale energy efficiency initiatives across various sectors in India. Its focus on energy-saving projects has led to the annual saving of 47 billion kWh and a reduction of 36.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. EESL’s efforts support a greener, more sustainable future for India.</p>
<h3>Other Energy Efficiency Initiatives in India</h3>
<p>India's energy efficiency initiatives are wide-ranging and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standards and Labeling (Bureau of Energy Efficiency - BEE)</li>
<li>The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022</li>
<li>National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE)</li>
<li>National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP)</li>
<li>Perform Achieve and Trade Scheme (PAT)</li>
<li>Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div class="conclusion">
<p>The UJALA scheme and SLNP have made significant contributions to India’s energy efficiency and sustainability.
