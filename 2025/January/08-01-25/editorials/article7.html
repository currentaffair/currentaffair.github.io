<h2>Key Challenges in India’s Digital Landscape</h2>
<h3>Digital Divide</h3>
<p>Despite the growing adoption of digital technologies, there remains a stark digital divide between urban and rural India.

<h3>Cybersecurity Threats</h3>
<p>With the surge in digital adoption, cybersecurity threats are becoming more prevalent. Data breaches, phishing attacks, and ransomware incidents are rising. Reports from the Data Security Council of India (DSCI) show that the country faces a significant shortage of cybersecurity professionals, with a gap of approximately 790,000 experts.</p>
