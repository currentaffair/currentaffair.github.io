        Household Consumption Expenditure Survey 2023-24
    </header>
<section>
<h2>Why in News?</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has released the factsheet of the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2023-24, providing key insights into consumption patterns and economic well-being in India.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Household Consumption Expenditure Survey</h2>
<p>The HCES collects data on household spending patterns to assess living standards, well-being, and consumption behavior.</p>
<p>HCES has been conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) since 1951 as part of the National Sample Survey (NSS) under the MoSPI.</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> HCES provides inputs for calculating Consumer Price Indices (CPI) and revising the base year for macroeconomic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is crucial for measuring poverty, inequality, and social well-being.</p>

<h2>Key Findings of the HCES 2023-24</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<h3>Rising Consumption</h3>
<p>Rural consumption spending increased significantly, with the average monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) rising to Rs 4,122, a 9.3% increase from Rs 3,773 in 2022-23. Similarly, urban areas showed an increase with an MPCE of Rs 6,996, up 8.3% from Rs 6,459 in 2022-23. This narrowing of the consumption gap between rural and urban areas indicates a growing rural consumption rate, which is outpacing urban growth.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<h3>Regional Disparities</h3>
<p>Sikkim had the highest MPCE, with rural spending at Rs 9,377 and urban spending at Rs 13,927. Conversely, Chhattisgarh recorded the lowest MPCE in both rural (Rs 2,739) and urban areas (Rs 4,927).</p>
<p>Other states like Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Kerala showed higher-than-average per capita consumption, while states such as West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh had lower-than-average spending.</p>
<p>Among the Union Territories, Chandigarh had the highest MPCE, with rural at Rs 8,857 and urban at Rs 13,425, while Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu recorded the lowest at Rs 4,311 (rural) and Jammu and Kashmir had Rs 6,327 (urban).</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<h3>Consumption Inequality</h3>
<p>The Consumption Inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, has decreased in both rural and urban areas. In rural areas, the Gini coefficient dropped from 0.266 to 0.237, and in urban areas, it fell from 0.314 to 0.284, indicating a reduction in inequality.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<h3>Food and Non-Food Expenditure</h3>
<p>Food expenditure in 2023-24 increased for both rural (47.04%) and urban (39.68%) areas, reversing previous declines. The highest food expenditure was on beverages, refreshments, and processed foods, followed by milk and vegetables.</p>
<p>The share of non-food expenditure remained high, with rural areas spending 52.96% and urban areas 60.32%. Rural households allocated more towards conveyance, medical expenses, and clothing, while urban households spent more on conveyance, miscellaneous goods, and rent.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<h3>Fractile Consumption Patterns</h3>
<p>For the top 5% of both rural and urban populations, consumption spending decreased compared to 2022-23. However, the bottom 5% saw significant increases, with rural spending rising 22% and urban spending growing 19%. This indicates economic improvement for lower-income groups.</p>
</div>

<h2>Implications of HCES Findings on Policy Making</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<h3>Rural Development</h3>
<p>The narrowing rural-urban gap suggests rising rural incomes, driven by initiatives like PM-KISAN and MGNREGA. This warrants continued policy support, particularly for rural infrastructure, including transport to reduce costs and increase economic opportunities in rural areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<h3>Sectoral Shifts</h3>
<p>The increasing expenditure on services such as conveyance and entertainment indicates a shift towards a service-driven economy. Policies should focus on skilling and job creation in emerging sectors and continue supporting rural industrialization to sustain growth.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<h3>Urban Planning and Housing</h3>
<p>High urban spending on rent and conveyance highlights the need for affordable housing policies and improved public transport infrastructure. Urban policies should also address stagnation in middle-class income growth to ensure equitable economic growth.</p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<h3>Regional Disparities</h3>
<p>States with lower-than-average consumption, like Bihar, require focused interventions in education, healthcare, and employment to foster economic activity and reduce disparities in consumption patterns.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<h3>Consumer Protection</h3>
<p>Policymakers should regulate the processed food industry to ensure quality standards and safeguard consumer interests.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey 2023-24 provides essential insights into the changing consumption patterns across rural and urban India. These findings have significant implications for policymaking, especially in areas of rural development, urban planning, and regional disparities. Ensuring equitable growth and improving the living standards of all sections of society will require targeted interventions based on these survey results.</p>
