    Pakistan's Strategic Dilemma: A Case of Self-Inflicted Wounds
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Pakistan’s foreign and security policies have been shaped by its long-standing rivalry with India. Over the years, Pakistan has adopted the strategy of using Afghanistan as "strategic depth" against perceived regional threats, especially India. However, this strategy has been increasingly problematic, leading to Pakistan's support for extremist groups like the Afghan Taliban. Now, with the Taliban’s return to power, this strategy has backfired, transforming Afghanistan into a "strategic ditch" for Pakistan.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Context of Pakistan’s Afghan Policy</h2>
    <p>
        For decades, Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies have provided logistical support and safe havens to the Afghan Taliban. This was intended to create a friendly regime in Kabul, ensuring that Pakistan would have a strategic advantage over India, particularly in the event of conflict. However, this support has led to unintended consequences, with the Taliban’s resurgence causing instability not only in Afghanistan but also within Pakistan’s own borders.
    </p>

    <h3>Pakistan’s Support to the Afghan Taliban</h3>
    <p>
        Pakistan’s backing of the Taliban was motivated by the need to counterbalance India’s influence in the region. Pakistan's military strategy hinged on maintaining a friendly government in Kabul that would serve as a buffer against any potential Indian aggression. This strategic calculus, however, has created a complicated relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban, which has now turned into a threat.
    </p>

    <h3>Strategic Depth Miscalculation</h3>
    <p>
        The concept of "strategic depth" was designed to ensure that Pakistan would have a strategic advantage by influencing Afghanistan’s political landscape. Yet, the Taliban’s return to power has resulted in a destabilized region, with Pakistan’s own security now at risk. This miscalculation highlights the dangers of relying on unstable, ideologically driven actors as strategic allies.
    </p>

    <h2>The Current Crisis with the TTP</h2>
    <p>
        The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot of the Afghan Taliban, has become a significant security threat to Pakistan. The TTP has engaged in numerous attacks on Pakistani soil, exploiting the Taliban's return to power. Despite Pakistan’s military operations, the TTP continues to pose a serious challenge to the state’s stability.
    </p>

    <h3>The TTP and Its Ideological Links with the Afghan Taliban</h3>
    <p>
        The TTP shares ideological and operational connections with the Afghan Taliban, which complicates Pakistan’s security situation. Pakistan has launched extensive counter-terrorism operations, including over 60,000 military missions, but the TTP remains deeply entrenched in certain areas. The Afghan Taliban’s refusal to take action against the TTP has left Pakistan with limited options.
    </p>

    <h3>Pakistan’s Failed Diplomatic Efforts</h3>
    <p>
        Diplomatic attempts to resolve the tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have largely failed. In December 2024, Pakistan’s envoy visited Kabul to de-escalate the crisis, but Pakistan’s airstrikes against TTP targets in Afghanistan only deepened the rift. The Afghan Taliban’s refusal to recognize the Durand Line as an official border further exacerbates the situation, with the Taliban’s stance on Pashtun nationalism making a resolution even more difficult.
    </p>

    <h2>Durand Line and Pashtun Nationalism</h2>
    <p>
        The Durand Line, which marks the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been a point of contention for over a century. The Taliban’s refusal to recognize the Durand Line as an official border has sparked renewed calls for Pashtunistan, a separate state for Pashtuns spanning both sides of the border. This has fueled Afghan irredentism and added to Pakistan’s security challenges, with ongoing resistance from Afghan forces to Pakistan’s attempts to fence the border.
    </p>

    <h3>Afghan Nationalism and the Durand Line Dispute</h3>
    <p>
        The rejection of the Durand Line by the Afghan Taliban is tied to a broader sense of Afghan nationalism, which holds that the Pashtun territories on the Pakistani side of the border rightfully belong to Afghanistan. This longstanding dispute complicates Pakistan’s efforts to secure its western frontier and maintain regional stability.
    </p>

    <h2>Pakistan’s Limited Options</h2>
    <p>
        Pakistan is under increasing pressure to act decisively against the TTP. There are calls within the country for U.S. drone bases to target the TTP, but such measures would risk further destabilizing the region. Moreover, Pakistan is reluctant to recognize the Taliban regime formally, as it faces an existential threat from the TTP and other extremist groups within its borders.
    </p>

    <h3>Diplomatic and Military Options</h3>
    <p>
        Pakistan's military coercion and diplomatic efforts have not yielded results, and Islamabad’s options are becoming increasingly limited. The internal political pressure to take a stronger stance against the TTP is growing, yet Pakistan’s strategy remains mired in a complex web of historical and geopolitical factors.
    </p>

    <h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Pakistan’s Afghan policy has created a security dilemma of its own making. Its historical support for the Afghan Taliban and other extremist groups has backfired, turning former allies into security threats. The TTP-Taliban nexus, the dispute over the Durand Line, and Pashtun nationalism all contribute to a complex set of challenges that Pakistan is ill-equipped to handle. With limited options left, Pakistan’s foreign policy strategy is now a cautionary tale of how short-term strategic gains can lead to long-term security losses.
