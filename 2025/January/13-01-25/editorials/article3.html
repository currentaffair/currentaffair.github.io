    India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023: A Critical Analysis
</header>
<section>
<img alt="Digital Personal Data Protection Act" src="https://xpertslegal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Data-Protection-Act.jpg"/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In August 2024, India marked six years since the K.S. Puttaswamy judgment, which reaffirmed privacy as a fundamental right. This event also marked the annual “Privacy Supreme” event hosted by the Internet Freedom Foundation, which was not a celebration but a sombre reflection on the unfulfilled promises of digital privacy laws in India. The event saw social activist Nikhil Dey sharing disturbing accounts from Ajmer, Rajasthan, highlighting how Aadhaar, initially praised for its efficiency, has led to exclusion of vulnerable residents from essential services like pensions and rations. This grim reality should be central to any policy discussions around the Draft Digital Data Protection Rules, 2025.</p>
<h3>Executive Overreach and Lack of Transparency</h3>
<p>The draft Data Protection Rules, which build upon the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, raise concerns about executive overreach and vague governance. Rulemaking typically serves to clarify laws passed by Parliament, ensuring enforceability while providing administrative flexibility. However, the draft rules lack transparency, particularly regarding the powers granted to the government without sufficient oversight or public scrutiny.</p>
<h3>Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023: An Overview</h3>
<p>The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, which forms the basis for the draft rules, was passed in Parliament in August 2023. The law has been criticized as a product of democratic subversion. The provisions of the law suggest a broader policy agenda of “total state control,” which seems more aligned with the objectives of exercising power over citizens rather than safeguarding their privacy rights. The law's vague language, particularly the use of terms like “as may be prescribed,” provides the government with wide-ranging discretionary powers that are not adequately checked.</p>
<h3>Delay in Implementation and Unveiling of Draft Rules</h3>
<p>Despite its swift passage in August 2023, the implementation of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act remains in limbo. Sixteen months after its passage, the draft Data Protection Rules were unveiled, but the rules have been criticized for their lack of public engagement. The document, published as a 51-page PDF, lacks depth and fails to provide meaningful insights into the drafting process. Furthermore, the platform for submitting comments, MyGov, is seen as limiting broader public participation, with submissions treated as fiduciary and not publicly disclosed.</p>
<h3>Substantive Issues with the Data Protection Rules</h3>
<p>The Data Protection Rules are characterized by intentional vagueness and executive dominance. Key provisions of the rules, such as compliance obligations, are either self-determined by companies handling personal data or left to government discretion, undermining the intended purpose of protecting individuals' personal data.</p>
<h3>Rule 3: Consent Notices</h3>
<p>Rule 3 mandates “clear and plain language” for consent notices, but it fails to define what this means. Given India's vast linguistic and comprehension diversity, this lack of clarity could lead to generic or oversimplified notices that fail to provide critical information. This poses a significant risk for individuals, especially in a country where digital literacy is still a challenge.</p>
<h3>Ambiguity in Data Disclosure</h3>
<p>The rules require an “itemized description” of data but do not clarify what categories of data this applies to or how granular the disclosure should be. Additionally, there are no clear timelines for notifying users in the event of a data breach, which could leave individuals vulnerable in urgent situations. These issues should ideally be addressed by an independent regulatory authority, which the current framework lacks.</p>
<h3>No Independence for the Data Protection Board</h3>
<p>The absence of an independent regulatory body is a major flaw in the Data Protection Act. Instead of creating an autonomous regulatory body, the government consolidates power within itself. The Data Protection Board (DPB), which is supposed to adjudicate data breaches, is also subject to government influence. Its chairperson is selected by a committee chaired by the Cabinet Secretary, raising concerns about political control.</p>
<h3>Limitations of the DPB After Formation</h3>
<p>Even after its formation, the DPB remains constrained in its capacity to enforce meaningful data protection. Its authority is limited to determining breaches, and its members are subject to central government service conditions, compromising its independence. This undermines recommendations from past consultations, which stressed the importance of insulating regulatory bodies from political influence.</p>
<h3>Effectiveness of a Subservient DPB</h3>
<p>Given its limited power and lack of independence, the DPB may struggle to effectively enforce data protection. Rule 5, which exempts data processing for subsidies from consent requirements, highlights the potential for accountability gaps, particularly when dealing with powerful government bodies like UIDAI, which manages Aadhaar data.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, and its associated draft rules reflect a concerning trend toward government overreach and lack of transparency. As Nikhil Dey pointed out, the Act's provisions represent a shift toward state control over citizens' data, rather than safeguarding their rights. While the draft rules have been presented for public consultation, the limited scope for participation and the lack of clarity in the rules suggest that the government remains firmly in control. The absence of a truly independent regulatory authority further undermines the effectiveness of the Act. Ultimately, the question remains: who will be the master in India's data protection regime?</p>
<div class="conclusion">The digital leash is real. The effectiveness of the rules depends on meaningful engagement and an independent regulatory framework.</div>
