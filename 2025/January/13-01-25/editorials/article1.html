        Digital Personal Data Protection Rules in India
    </header>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules on January 3, 2025. This is a significant milestone for India in regulating digital personal data. The DPDP Act, passed in 2023, lays the foundation for a framework to protect personal data, moving closer to operationalising this regulatory system.</p>
<h2>Departure from the Personal Data Protection Bill</h2>
<h3>Overly Restrictive and Hostile to Industry</h3>
<p>The draft rules mark a shift from the earlier Personal Data Protection Bill, which was criticised for being overly restrictive and not in line with industry interests. The Bill underwent extensive consultations and framing, but ultimately, it was rescinded. The DPDP rules, on the other hand, reflect a less prescriptive, principles-based approach, which has been well-received by businesses and the media.</p>
<h3>Brussels Effect and GDPR Criticism</h3>
<p>Unlike the rush to implement GDPR-like rules seen in the "Brussels Effect," India's rules aim to strike a balance between regulation and business autonomy. GDPR, once praised for setting global standards, has faced criticism for favouring large corporations, stifling smaller businesses, and failing to significantly build public trust.</p>
<h2>The Hits: Pragmatism and Flexibility</h2>
<h3>Simplicity and Clarity</h3>
<p>One of the standout features of the DPDP rules is their simplicity. While the GDPR has cumbersome requirements, such as notifications about cross-border data transfers and automated decision-making, India’s rules focus on clarity, which aims to reduce consent fatigue and avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary details.</p>
<h3>Reducing Consent Fatigue</h3>
<p>The European Union has faced growing frustration over incessant consent pop-ups. India's approach is designed to avoid the burdens caused by prescriptive regulations, offering a more streamlined process for user consent.</p>
<h2>India’s Approach to User Rights and Consent Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Unlike the GDPR, which is prescriptive in terms of how businesses should enable users to exercise their rights, India’s rules focus on outcomes rather than processes. The DPDP rules empower users to correct, erase, withdraw consent, and seek information from entities without forcing businesses to follow a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
<h2>Protection of Children’s Personal Data</h2>
<p>The DPDP rules provide stricter protection for children’s data compared to other types of personal data. However, exemptions are allowed for certain industries, such as educational institutions, which benefit from monitoring and tracking for academic purposes without needing parental consent.</p>
<h2>The Misses: Data Localisation and Overreach</h2>
<h3>Complexity in Cross-Border Data Flow</h3>
<p>The draft rules introduce ambiguity regarding cross-border data flows, especially concerning Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs), large enterprises handling substantial data. The localisation mandates could introduce regulatory arbitrage risks and deter investment.</p>
<h3>Localisation Provision and Law Enforcement Challenges</h3>
<p>The localisation provisions stem from concerns over law enforcement access to cross-border data. While such provisions are understandable, they could be more sector-specific, following the example of India’s 2018 mandate for localising payment data, which was tailored to the financial sector.</p>
<h2>Areas Requiring Greater Clarity</h2>
<p>Some aspects of the DPDP rules require more clarity, such as safeguards for verifying user requests and handling excessive or repetitive information requests. Additionally, the role of the government in accessing sensitive business data is not yet fully addressed.</p>
<h2>What Lies Ahead</h2>
<p>With data breaches costing Indian businesses an average of ₹19.5 crore ($2.35 million) in 2024, India must adopt more robust privacy frameworks. Compliance with data protection laws should not be seen merely as a regulatory obligation but as essential for safeguarding business reputation and continuity.</p>
<h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The DPDP Rules offer a flexible approach to personal data protection, contrasting with the more rigid systems implemented globally. As India moves towards refining these rules, it must prioritise balancing industry needs with individual privacy rights while fostering an environment of innovation.</p>
