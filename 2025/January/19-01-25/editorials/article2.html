<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The economic landscape of India in 2024-25 presents both opportunities and challenges, with significant implications for growth, government expenditure, and global economic factors. Real GDP growth is projected at 6.4%, slightly below the Reserve Bank of India’s revised estimate. This article analyzes the forecasted economic trends, factors contributing to growth, and government expenditure patterns that will shape India's economy in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Real GDP Growth and Projections</h2>
<h3>2024-25 Growth Estimate</h3>
<p>The First Advance Estimates (FAE) for the year 2024-25 indicate a real GDP growth of 6.4%. This estimate is slightly below the RBI’s revised estimate of 6.6%, reflecting slower than expected growth in sectors like manufacturing.</p>
<h3>Nominal GDP Growth</h3>
<p>Nominal GDP growth is projected to be 9.7%, which is lower than the Union Budget's estimate of 10.5%. This reduction is a consequence of moderating inflation and global economic uncertainties, including the impact of the ongoing pandemic and supply chain disruptions.</p>
<h3>Growth Breakdown</h3>
<p>The growth pattern is expected to improve in the second half of the year. The first half of 2024-25 is projected to grow at 6%, while the second half will likely see a growth rate of 6.7%, indicating a recovery from the earlier slowdown.</p>
<h3>Impact of Decline from Previous Year</h3>
<p>Real GDP growth has dropped from 8.2% in 2023-24 to 6.4% in 2024-25. This decline is largely due to slower growth in the manufacturing sector, which saw a significant slowdown from 9.9% growth in 2023-24 to 5.3% in 2024-25.</p>
<h2>Government Expenditure and Investment</h2>
<h3>Capital Expenditure</h3>
<p>The government's capital expenditure target for 2024-25 was set at ₹11.1 lakh crore, but only ₹5.14 lakh crore (46.2%) was achieved in the first eight months. This shortfall has had a significant impact on overall GDP growth.</p>
<h3>Importance for Sustained Growth</h3>
<p>Capital expenditure plays a crucial role in stimulating economic growth by boosting private investment and driving domestic demand. Given the global economic uncertainty, the focus on increasing capital expenditure is essential to stabilize and accelerate economic growth in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Growth Forecast for 2025-26</h2>
<p>The growth forecast for 2025-26 is expected to stabilize at 6.5%, with assumptions that Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) remains at around 33.4%, and the Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) stays at 5.1%. However, global uncertainties and their impact on exports and investments could dampen growth prospects.</p>
<h2>Medium- to Long-Term Projections</h2>
<h3>Steady Economic Growth</h3>
<p>India’s Real GDP is projected to grow steadily at 6.5% over the next five years, while nominal GDP growth will range between 10.5% and 11%. Inflation is expected to remain around 4%, based on the implicit price deflator.</p>
<h3>Achieving Developed Country Status</h3>
<p>India could achieve developed country status within 25 years if economic growth remains steady and the exchange rate depreciates by an average of 2.5% per year. However, the increasing base effect may make it difficult to maintain higher growth rates in later years.</p>
<h2>Challenges Impacting Growth</h2>
<h3>Capital Expenditure Slowdown</h3>
<p>One of the major reasons for the slowdown in 2024-25 has been the slower-than-expected capital expenditure by the government. Additionally, the impact of global uncertainties has affected exports and investment flows, contributing to the lower-than-expected growth.</p>
<h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Indian economy is facing significant challenges in 2024-25, with slower growth in key sectors such as manufacturing and government expenditure falling short of expectations. However, there are opportunities for recovery, especially if capital expenditure and private investment are prioritized. In the long term, India’s steady growth trajectory, supported by domestic demand and sustained capital investment, will be essential for achieving its development goals.</p>
