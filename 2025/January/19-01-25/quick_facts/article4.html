<p>Israel's Security Cabinet has approved a ceasefire deal with Hamas, pending final approval. The ceasefire may begin as early as Sunday.</p>
<h2>Hostage Exchange Agreement</h2>
<p>Under the deal, 33 hostages will be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. A second phase will focus on releasing the remaining hostages, including soldiers.</p>
<h2>Mediatorsâ€™ Role</h2>
<p>Qatar and the U.S. mediated the agreement, with delays blamed on Hamas, according to Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>
<h2>Political Repercussions</h2>
<p>The deal faces opposition from Netanyahu's far-right allies, adding political instability to Israel's government.</p>
<h2>Contextual Background</h2>
<p>The October 7 attack by Hamas started the 15-month conflict. The death toll on both sides is staggering, with over 46,000 Palestinians killed and significant Israeli casualties.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Impact</h2>
<p>Millions of Palestinians have faced displacement and destruction, with severe humanitarian needs. The ceasefire is expected to allow aid to flow into Gaza.</p>
<h2>Immediate Implications</h2>
<p>The truce will allow for the return of hostages and humanitarian aid, with Israel preparing for the recovery of captives.</p>
<h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>
<p>The second phase of negotiations will be more difficult, especially with Hamas demanding an Israeli withdrawal in exchange for more hostages.</p>
<h2>Long-term Ceasefire Prospects</h2>
<p>Hamas seeks a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal. However, Israel's stance on dismantling Hamas complicates the path to peace.</p>
