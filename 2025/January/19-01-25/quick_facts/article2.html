<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>On January 6, 2025, a flood occurred at a rat-hole coal mine in Kalamati, Assam, trapping nine miners. By January 16, only four bodies have been recovered, highlighting the difficulties in rescue operations.</p>
<h2>Rat-Hole Mining and Risks</h2>
<p>Rat-hole mining involves narrow vertical shafts for coal extraction and is banned due to its dangers. Miners, seeking higher wages, face significant risks including asphyxiation, tunnel collapse, drowning, and exposure to toxic gases.</p>
<h2>Mining Season and Challenges</h2>
<p>Mining mainly occurs between November and March, but the mines frequently flood during the rainy season, as seen in the Kalamati tragedy. This mining method is highly labor-intensive with minimal safety measures.</p>
<h2>Government Response</h2>
<p>The Assam Cabinet approved a judicial inquiry into the incident. Despite a Supreme Court ban on rat-hole mining in 2014, illegal mining continues, with entrenched corruption and coal syndicates controlling operations.</p>
<h2>Impact on Miners and Future Outlook</h2>
<p>Miners fear stricter enforcement will reduce their earnings. However, many remain hopeful about coal demand, despite concerns over the sustainability of such dangerous practices and their long-term environmental impact.</p>
