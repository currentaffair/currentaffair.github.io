<p>The Union government is linking digital IDs (e.g., Aadhaar) to land records for efficient implementation of agricultural policies. This initiative aims to create a comprehensive database of farmers, which will allow better targeting of policies and direct beneficiary transfers.</p>
<h2>Scope of the Drive</h2>
<p>10 million farmers across 10 states have been covered in the digitisation process, with the goal of enhancing access to government schemes and benefits.</p>
<h2>Kisan Pehchaan Patra</h2>
<p>A unique digital ID, known as the ‘Kisan Pehchaan Patra,’ includes key details such as land holdings, crops grown, and other relevant agricultural data, facilitating easier access to benefits.</p>
<h2>Current Challenges</h2>
<p>Approximately 80% of farmers in India are landless or marginal, and it remains uncertain how these farmers will be included in the digitisation drive, as they do not have land records for linkage.</p>
<h2>Census Implications</h2>
<p>The digitisation effort aligns with the upcoming Census, which is expected to provide more data for the agricultural database.</p>
