<h1>Courts Must Not Use Abetment of Suicide Charge Mechanically</h1>

<h2>Relevance: GS 2 (Governance, Judiciary)</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled on a case where a financial company employee's actions led to a young man's suicide. The accused had demanded the repayment of a loan, which resulted in the suicide. The Supreme Court set aside the Madhya Pradesh High Court's decision and emphasized that charges under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) must not be applied mechanically.</p>
<h2>Court’s Ruling</h2>
<p>The Court stressed that police authorities must carefully examine facts before invoking Section 306, ensuring a clear connection between the accused’s actions and the victim’s decision to end their life. It was also emphasized that emotional or angry remarks should not automatically result in charges unless there is evidence of active instigation or facilitation.</p>
<h2>Criteria for Abetment</h2>
<p>For a charge of abetment to be proven, the accused must have actively instigated or created conditions that led to the victim’s suicide. Mere remarks made in anger without foreseeing the consequences do not meet the criteria for abetment.</p>
<h2>Judicial Caution</h2>
<p>The Court advised trial courts to avoid the “play it safe” syndrome and to only file charges when there is clear evidence. It emphasized the importance of avoiding overuse of this serious charge in emotionally charged cases like suicides.</p>
<h2>Role of Investigating Agencies</h2>
<p>The Court highlighted that investigating agencies should be sensitized to Section 306 and avoid resorting to the charge hastily to appease public sentiment or the victim’s family.</p>
<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>This ruling serves as a reminder for judicial and law enforcement authorities to exercise due diligence, ensuring that criminal charges, particularly in cases of suicide, are not misused or filed without proper investigation. It could set a precedent for responsible legal processes surrounding such sensitive cases.</p>
