<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The use of elephants in religious ceremonies, especially in Kerala, has raised serious concerns about animal welfare and public safety. A male elephant recently ran amok in Malappuram during an annual feast, injuring 24 people. This follows the death of 24 elephants in Kerala in 2024, highlighting issues surrounding captive elephant care.</p>
<h2>Key Issues</h2>
<p>Captive elephants are often subjected to extreme stress, which can lead to erratic behavior. There are concerns about mistreatment during traditional events like temple festivals. The Kerala High Court imposed restrictions on the use of elephants, but violations persist.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Response</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court temporarily stayed restrictions on elephant usage in festivals, leading to further concerns. Meanwhile, the Indian government is investigating the use of DNA testing to track the origins of captive elephants and curb illegal practices.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>There are numerous challenges in the breeding and sourcing of elephants, including sourcing from wild populations and dealing with aggressive behavior from males in musth. The cultural significance of elephants in religious ceremonies further complicates the situation.</p>
<h2>Future Considerations</h2>
<p>Stricter enforcement of laws and regulations is needed to balance cultural traditions with animal welfare and safety. The government and the Supreme Court are being urged to take stronger actions.</p>
