<h2>Why in News?</h2>
<p>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is facing an increasing challenge in weather forecasting due to climatic changes and the rise of extreme weather events. A focus on improving weather resilience and climate change adaptation is emphasized in the IMD Vision-2047 document.</p>
<h2>Key Facts</h2>
<p>IMD forecasts an increase in extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, thunderstorms, and cold waves, by 80%-88%. It aims to improve forecasting capabilities to handle these challenges.</p>
<h2>Evolution of Meteorology in India</h2>
<p>India’s meteorological history dates back to 1793 with the establishment of one of the oldest observatories in Madras. Modernization efforts continue with new meteorological centers established in various regions, such as Leh, Shillong, Amravati, Port Blair, and Imphal in 2023.</p>
<h2>Challenges in Forecasting</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extreme Weather Events:</strong> Climate change has led to more frequent and unpredictable extreme weather events.</li>
<li><strong>Localized and Short-Term Events:</strong> Weather events often occur in small timeframes or specific locations, making predictions difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Regions with Limited Data:</strong> Areas with difficult terrain and remote regions pose challenges for data collection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>IMD's Efforts to Improve Forecasting</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved forecast accuracy over the years, with the ability to predict severe weather events up to five days in advance.</li>
<li>Launch of Mission Mausam as part of IMD’s 150th Anniversary, with an investment of ₹22,000 crore until 2026.</li>
<li>Technological advancements such as radar expansion and crowdsourcing for real-time weather feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mission Mausam</h2>
<p>Mission Mausam aims to expand the observational network, improve forecasting accuracy, and provide better decision-making tools for disaster managers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through its Vision-2047 strategy and Mission Mausam, the IMD is enhancing its ability to predict and manage extreme weather events, contributing to climate change adaptation and resilience.</p>
