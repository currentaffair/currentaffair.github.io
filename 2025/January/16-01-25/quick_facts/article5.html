<h1>The Parbati-Kalisindh-Chambal-Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (PKC-ERCP)</h1>
<img alt="The Parbati-Kalisindh-Chambal-Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project" src="https://i0.wp.com/gokulamseekias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/photo_2024-01-31_14-28-18.jpg"/>
<p>The PKC-ERCP is designed to link rivers in Rajasthan for better water distribution. The project aims to supply water to 23 districts for irrigation, drinking, and industrial needs. A key component, the Doongri Dam, will be built on the Banas River, which could have significant environmental consequences, especially for the Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve.</p>
<h2>Environmental Impact on Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve</h2>
<p>37 sq km of land within the reserve is expected to be submerged due to the dam, leading to a loss of habitat and potential fragmentation of the reserve. This could disrupt wildlife connectivity, particularly for tigers, risking genetic isolation and affecting breeding patterns.</p>
<h2>Ecological Concerns</h2>
<p>Besides habitat destruction, human-wildlife conflict may increase as animals move into human settlements. Although the reservoir could provide water relief, improper management may harm the reserve's ecological integrity.</p>
<h2>Criticism of the Project Design</h2>
<p>Conservationists argue that compensatory land should match the ecological quality of the lost land. Some experts recommend allocating double or triple the forest area for compensatory afforestation to mitigate environmental damage.</p>
<h2>Broader Environmental and Development Issues</h2>
<p>Development projects like river-linking projects often clash with conservation goals. International best practices suggest that large infrastructure projects should avoid critical habitats and prioritize sustainable planning to minimize environmental harm.</p>
<h2>Government’s Position and Expert Views</h2>
<p>The Rajasthan Government and the Central Government are assessing the project details to ensure environmental standards are met. Experts like Dr. Rajesh Gopal and conservationists argue for prioritizing conservation over development and suggest alternative measures to minimize ecological disruption.</p>
<h2>Future of Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve</h2>
<p>If submergence is unavoidable, experts recommend establishing wildlife corridors and compensating with high-quality forest areas to maintain the ecosystem's health. Ranthambhore’s role as a vital tiger sanctuary makes it irreplaceable in India’s conservation efforts.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The PKC-ERCP must balance development with the conservation of critical areas like Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve. Moving forward, India should prioritize protected areas as no-go zones for large infrastructure projects.</p>
