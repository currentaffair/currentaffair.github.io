<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In recent years, the world has witnessed unprecedented warming, with 2024 marking the warmest year on record. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has confirmed this trend, with global average temperatures exceeding critical thresholds. India, despite experiencing a temperature rise, remains somewhat less affected than the global average, prompting further study into regional variations and their impacts.</p>
<h2>Key Findings by the WMO</h2>
<p>The WMO’s 2024 report highlights critical developments in global climate patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Global Temperature:</strong> In 2024, the global surface temperature exceeded pre-industrial levels by 1.55°C, marking the first instance of surpassing the 1.5°C threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Ocean Heat:</strong> The oceans absorbed a record 16 zettajoules of heat, significantly contributing to the overall warming.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature Assessment:</strong> While the global temperature exceeded 1.5°C, the Paris Agreement's goals are still within reach.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Warming in India</h3>
<p>India's temperature rise has been somewhat lower compared to global averages. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported a 0.65°C increase above normal levels, significantly lower than the global rise of 1.55°C. This is mainly due to factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographic Location:</strong> India, being a tropical country, doesn't experience temperature increases as extreme as those at higher latitudes.</li>
<li><strong>Albedo Effect:</strong> The melting of Arctic ice contributes significantly to warming, but the effect in India is less pronounced, especially outside the Himalayan regions.</li>
<li><strong>Aerosols and Pollution:</strong> High air pollution in India, while harmful in many ways, has had a slight cooling effect due to aerosol-induced cloud formation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences of Rising Global Temperatures</h2>
<p>Global warming has far-reaching consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sea Level Rise:</strong> Global sea levels have risen by about 8 inches since 1880 and are expected to rise another foot by 2100, threatening coastal communities.</li>
<li><strong>Droughts and Heat Waves:</strong> Prolonged droughts and severe heatwaves are anticipated to become more frequent, endangering agriculture and increasing fire risks.</li>
<li><strong>Biodiversity Loss:</strong> Rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns disrupt ecosystems, driving many species toward extinction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How India Can Better Observe Global Warming</h2>
<p>India needs to enhance its climate monitoring capabilities to better assess and respond to global warming:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expansion of Weather Stations:</strong> Increasing the number of weather stations, especially in rural areas, will enable more accurate data collection.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Computing Capabilities:</strong> Investing in advanced computational resources will allow for better climate modeling and disaster management.</li>
<li><strong>Localized Impact Studies:</strong> Conducting region-specific studies will help India address climate challenges more effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)?</h2>
<p>The WMO is a specialized UN agency responsible for coordinating global weather, climate, and hydrology efforts. With 192 member states, it plays a crucial role in tackling climate change worldwide.</p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>To combat global warming, a comprehensive approach is needed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Six-Sector Approach:</strong> Targeting energy, agriculture, industry, transport, forestry, and buildings for emission reduction.</li>
<li><strong>Reforestation and Afforestation:</strong> Increasing tree coverage to absorb CO₂ and restore biodiversity.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Promoting energy-efficient technologies across sectors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The challenge of global warming requires global cooperation and regional adaptation strategies. India must continue to monitor and address its unique climatic challenges, while also contributing to global efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>
