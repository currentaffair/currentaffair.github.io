<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) is an important event for the Indian diaspora, which brings together millions of people of Indian origin from across the globe. The event serves as a platform to celebrate the contributions of the Indian diaspora while also discussing the challenges they face. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the inauguration of the 18th edition of PBD, referred to the Indian diaspora as "India’s ambassadors to the world."</p>
<p>With over 35 million people globally, the diaspora plays a significant role in the development of both their host countries and India. PBD provides an opportunity to recognize the diaspora's successes, while also shedding light on pressing issues that affect their communities.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Indian Diaspora</h3>
<p>The Indian diaspora is celebrated for its successful integration into local societies, active involvement in community service, and notable contributions to various sectors. Many Indian-origin individuals have ascended to leadership roles across more than 30 countries. NRIs and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) have made significant strides in professional fields, contributing to a diverse array of industries worldwide.</p>

<h3>The Broader Agenda of PBD</h3>
<p>While the event celebrates the achievements of the diaspora, it should not become a mere platform for self-congratulation. There is a critical need to address the challenges faced by the diaspora, particularly those who are still Indian nationals. Issues like the rise of far-right populism and its impact on visa and entry conditions should be central to the discourse. Additionally, the precarious situation of Indian workers in regions like West Asia, where over 9 million Indians live, must be addressed in light of ongoing global conflicts.</p>
<h3>Challenges Facing the Indian Diaspora</h3>
<h4>Rise of Far-Right Populism</h4>
<p>Far-right populist movements are gaining ground globally, especially in the West. These governments pose a growing challenge to the Indian diaspora by implementing stricter visa and immigration policies, which hinder the movement and settlement of Indian nationals abroad. The Indian government must take proactive steps to ensure the protection and fair treatment of its citizens abroad.</p>
<h4>Global Conflicts</h4>
<p>The diaspora, especially those living in regions like West Asia, faces risks due to ongoing conflicts and political instability. With millions of Indians in these regions, the Indian government must develop strategies to safeguard their welfare, ensuring their safety amidst conflicts.</p>
<h4>Economic Migration</h4>
<p>Economic migration is a key driver of the Indian diaspora. Many individuals migrate abroad seeking better economic opportunities. However, this has led to a "brain drain" from India, where talented professionals leave the country in search of better prospects. While the contributions of the diaspora are laudable, it is crucial for India to address this loss by creating more opportunities within the country to prevent skilled individuals from seeking employment abroad.</p>
<h3>The Need for Inclusive and Non-Partisan Engagement</h3>
<p>India’s relationship with its diaspora must be inclusive, fostering constructive dialogue and mutual benefit. The engagement should not be partisan or politically motivated, as there is concern over the targeting of individuals or groups based on their political stance. The Indian government must ensure that its interactions with the diaspora remain focused on safeguarding the interests of Indian nationals abroad.</p>

<div class="conclusion">
<p>In conclusion, the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas not only celebrates the immense contributions of the Indian diaspora but also serves as a critical platform to address the challenges that they face. From political obstacles to economic migration and safety concerns in global conflict zones, there is a need for continued engagement and policy support from the Indian government. By acknowledging both the achievements and challenges of the diaspora, India can ensure a more inclusive and supportive relationship with its global citizens.</p>
