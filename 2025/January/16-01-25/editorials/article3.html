        Privatisation of Power DISCOMs
    </header>
    <section>
        <img src="title-image.jpg" alt="Power DISCOMs" />
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In December 2024, the Supreme Court upheld the Punjab and Haryana High Court's decision, supporting the government's intent to privatize the power distribution companies (DISCOMs) in Chandigarh. This move highlights the ongoing challenges in India's power sector and the push towards privatization to address systemic inefficiencies and financial strain on public-sector DISCOMs.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the Need for Privatisation of Power DISCOMs?</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h4>High AT&C Losses</h4>
            <p>
                Despite improvements, India’s Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses remain high at 17.6% in FY24. These losses include electricity theft and unbilled supply, which undermine the financial health of DISCOMs, limiting their capacity to invest in infrastructure and reducing operational efficiency.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h4>Systemic Inefficiencies</h4>
            <p>
                Billing efficiency at 87% and collection efficiency at 97.3% reflect persistent operational inefficiencies. The inefficiency gaps lead to reduced revenue generation, exacerbating financial strain.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Escalating Financial Strain</h3>
        <p>
            The widening gap between the average cost of supply (ACS) and average realizable revenue (ARR), growing from 33 paise per unit in FY22 to 55 paise per unit in FY23, further burdens DISCOMs. This gap deepens their debt and increases reliance on state subsidies, creating an unsustainable financial model for power distribution.
        </p>

        <h3>Subsidy Burden on States</h3>
        <p>
            The financial deficit in India’s power distribution sector ballooned to Rs 79,000 crore in FY23 from Rs 44,000 crore in FY22, highlighting the unsustainable financial management and the urgent need for reform.
        </p>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Rising Power Demand and Costs</h4>
            <p>
                A sharp rise of 8% in power demand during FY23, coupled with reliance on costly coal imports, pushed power purchase costs up by 71 paise/kWh. Without structural changes, these rising costs could lead to more financial instability for DISCOMs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Demonstrated Success in Private Models</h3>
        <p>
            In Delhi, privatization led to a reduction in AT&C losses from over 50% in 2002 to single-digit levels, demonstrating the potential benefits of privatization. Additionally, the Delhi government saved approximately Rs. 1,200 crores annually, previously spent on the Delhi Vidyut Board.
        </p>

        <h3>Ineffectiveness of Current Public-Sector Reforms</h3>
        <p>
            Government initiatives like the UDAY scheme have shown limited success in curbing losses or improving operational efficiency. Private-sector involvement is considered essential for introducing professional management, modern technologies, and accountability.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges of Privatisation of DISCOMs</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h4>Employee Resistance to Privatisation</h4>
            <p>
                Many employees of public-sector DISCOMs oppose privatization due to concerns over job security and service conditions. Previous experiences, such as Delhi’s voluntary retirement scheme, have shown significant fears regarding job losses and financial instability.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Complex Legal and Regulatory Environment</h3>
        <p>
            The privatization process is complicated by the need to comply with the Electricity Act, 2003, and other legal hurdles, leading to delays and confusion. For example, in Chandigarh, legal challenges regarding the private bidder’s compliance with statutory requirements have caused significant delays.
        </p>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Tariff Concerns for Consumers</h4>
            <p>
                Post-privatization, there may be tariff increases to cover operational costs and infrastructure investments, raising concerns about affordability for consumers. Striking a balance between cost recovery and affordability remains a major challenge.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Lack of Transitional Support</h3>
        <p>
            The absence of adequate financial and operational support during Odisha’s failed privatization in the 1990s underscores the importance of proper transitional assistance. In contrast, Delhi’s success was backed by Rs. 3,450 crores in transitional funds, which helped manage early operational challenges.
        </p>

        <h2>Government Steps to Support State DISCOMs</h2>
        <h3>Schemes</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h4>Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY)</h4>
            <p>
                Launched in 2015, UDAY aimed to reduce DISCOM debt by allowing states to take on 75% of liabilities as low-interest bonds. The scheme sought to improve AT&C losses and billing efficiency through measures like smart metering and theft reduction.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS)</h3>
        <p>
            With a budget of Rs. 3,03,758 crore, this scheme aims to reduce AT&C losses to 12-15% and eliminate the ACS-ARR gap by FY 2024-25.
        </p>

        <h3>Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS)</h3>
        <p>
            Focused on strengthening urban power distribution infrastructure, IPDS aims to reduce technical losses and improve customer service.
        </p>

        <h3>Financial Assistance and Subsidies</h3>
        <p>
            In FY23, state governments ensured DISCOMs could operate despite losses by disbursing 108% of tariff subsidies. For example, Rs. 3,450 crores helped stabilize Delhi's operations post-privatization.
        </p>

        <h2>Way Forward</h2>
        <p>
            Moving forward, a collaborative approach that includes all stakeholders, such as employees, consumers, and political groups, is essential for a smooth transition. Clear communication regarding safeguards and gradual tariff adjustments can help build trust.
        </p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The privatization of DISCOMs presents both opportunities and challenges. By leveraging best practices, strengthening regulatory frameworks, and ensuring adequate transitional support, India can move towards a more efficient and sustainable power distribution model. The role of the government in facilitating this transition through targeted reforms is critical for ensuring long-term success.
