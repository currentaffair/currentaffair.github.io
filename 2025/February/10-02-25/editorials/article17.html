The Budget attempts to balance <div class="highlight">fiscal expansion with fiscal consolidation</div> to address these macroeconomic challenges while ensuring sustainable development.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Macroeconomic Context and Budgetary Stance</h2> <p><strong>Economic Slowdown:</strong> Quarterly GDP figures reveal a notable slowdown, necessitating <div class="highlight">calibrated fiscal measures</div> to sustain growth and maintain macroeconomic stability.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal Consolidation:</strong> The Budget adheres to the fiscal responsibility framework, <div class="important">targeting a fiscal deficit of 4.4% of GDP for 2025-26</div>, down from 5.1% in the previous fiscal year.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Revenue and Expenditure Trends</h2> <p>The Budget projects a <div class="highlight">marginal increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio</div> in 2025-26, indicating improved revenue collection. The continued decline in the revenue deficit reflects enhanced fiscal discipline. Total expenditure is expected to decline to 14.6% of GDP in 2025-26, emphasizing efficient resource allocation.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Objectives of the Budget</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Accelerate Growth:</strong> Stimulate economic recovery amid the slowdown.</li> <li><strong>Secure Inclusive Development:</strong> Promote equitable growth across sectors and regions.</li> <li><strong>Invigorate Private Sector Investments:</strong> Encourage private capital inflows and boost business confidence.</li> <li><strong>Uplift Household Sentiments:</strong> Enhance disposable income and consumer spending, particularly among the middle class.</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h2>Key Measures and Reforms</h2> <h3>Taxation Reforms</h3> <p>Significant upward revisions in income tax slabs provide relief to the middle class. The simplification of the tax structure aims to <div class="highlight">ease compliance</div> and broaden the tax base. Rationalisation of customs duties supports domestic industries and enhances global competitiveness.</p> <h3>Fiscal Expansion Tools</h3> <p>Revised income tax slabs boost disposable income, while targeted expenditure focuses on supporting lower-income households, enhancing social welfare and economic resilience.</p> <h3>Sectoral Reforms</h3> <p>The Budget prioritizes key sectors such as <div class="highlight">urban development, mining, financial services, and power</div>. Enhanced Centre-state coordination aims to implement next-generation reforms, particularly in state-governed domains.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Challenges and Concerns</h2> <h3>Growth and Inflation Dynamics</h3> <p>The Budget assumes a nominal GDP growth of 10.1% for 2025-26, implying <div class="highlight">real GDP growth of 6%</div> with inflation at 4% or lower. However, elevated inflation levels pose challenges to achieving these targets.</p> <h3>Household Indebtedness and Savings</h3> <p>Rising household debt, coupled with a declining savings rate, reflects a shift from safe savings to riskier assets such as stocks. This trend increases financial vulnerabilities and calls for policy interventions to promote financial stability.</p> <h3>Private Sector and Investment Challenges</h3> <p>Subdued private sector investments and slower corporate earnings highlight the need for proactive measures, including <div class="highlight">deregulation and improved ease of doing business</div>, to bolster investor confidence.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Way Forward: Policy Recommendations</h2> <h3>Strengthening Fiscal and Monetary Coordination</h3> <p>Align fiscal, monetary, and financial sector policies to address household indebtedness and savings challenges. Promote safe saving opportunities to reduce speculative investments and ensure financial stability.</p> <h3>Encouraging Household Savings</h3> <p>Introduce policies that incentivize household savings while monitoring rising personal loans to mitigate financial stress.</p> <h3>Centre-State Collaboration</h3> <p>Establish a consultative mechanism for implementing state-level reforms, focusing on deregulation and sectoral reforms to catalyze growth.</p> <h3>Inflation Management</h3> <p>Implement measures to bring inflation down to 4% or lower, supporting nominal GDP growth assumptions and addressing supply-side constraints influenced by global geopolitical uncertainties.</p> </section> <section class="conclusion"> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p><div class="important">The government must adopt a balanced approach to financialisation in the economy</div>. The Economic Survey 2024-25 emphasized the need for policies that encourage household savings, reduce excessive financialisation, and provide safe saving opportunities. Such measures will enhance financial stability and better equip the economy to navigate global shocks amid the current uncertain environment.</p> </section></body></html>
