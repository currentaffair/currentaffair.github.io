This summit is the third of its kind, following AI safety-focused meetings in the U.K. (2023) and South Korea (2024). Beyond AI safety, the Paris summit aims to address innovation, public interest AI, the future of work, and governance issues, offering India a platform to amplify the voice of the Global South.</p> <p><div class="highlight">India’s participation presents an opportunity to shape global AI policies while championing the unique needs of developing nations.</div></p> </section> <section> <h2>Voice of the Global South</h2> <p>The first AI summit in Bletchley Park focused on ‘frontier AI models’ and the launch of the U.K. AI Safety Institute (AISI). The second meeting in Seoul expanded to multilateral collaboration on AI risk management with countries such as the U.S., France, Japan, and the EU. India has been an active participant in these discussions, signaling its commitment to global AI safety.</p> <p>India’s role extends beyond AI safety. Under its G20 presidency in 2023, India endorsed a “pro-innovation regulatory approach” to balance AI development and safety. Hosting the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) in December 2023, India emphasized equitable access to AI resources for the Global South.</p> <p><div class="important">India’s efforts to establish its own AI Safety Institute will further solidify its leadership role in shaping AI governance frameworks that prioritize inclusivity and safety.</div></p> </section> <section> <h2>Priorities in Paris</h2> <p>India’s vision for the Global South can be advanced through three strategic priorities at the Paris summit:</p> <h3>1. Democratizing Access to AI</h3> <p>India should advocate for equitable access to AI resources across the value chain. This includes not just computing hardware but also datasets, cloud platforms, foundational models, and development tools. India’s domestic initiative—establishing a common computing facility with over 18,600 GPUs and a 40% government subsidy—sets a precedent for such efforts.</p> <p>Promoting distributed computing solutions and open-source AI models, such as DeepSeek, can democratize AI development. India must also push for flexible cross-border AI technology transfers while ensuring safety standards are met.</p> <h3>2. Developing Contextual Frameworks</h3> <p>India should champion frameworks that identify AI use-cases tailored to the Global South’s unique challenges. This ensures AI solutions are relevant and impactful rather than generic applications.</p> <p>Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Early disease detection systems adapted to local healthcare infrastructure.</li> <li>Personalized learning platforms for diverse educational environments.</li> <li>Agricultural tools designed for regional farming practices.</li> </ul> <p>The establishment of an AI use-case repository post-summit could guide nations in prioritizing relevant applications.</p> <h3>3. Balancing Risks and Safety</h3> <p>AI safety frameworks must account for the unique risks faced by the Global South, which differ significantly from those of the Global North. For instance, cultural erosion from exposure to AI models trained on predominantly Western data is a specific concern.</p> <p>The International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, led by Yoshua Benjio, stresses that risk is a function of both the probability and severity of harm. India should advocate for evidence-based risk assessment rooted in Global South contexts, establishing a repository of AI-related harms to inform future regulatory approaches.</p> </section> <section class="conclusion"> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>As co-chair of the Paris AI summit, India is uniquely positioned to champion the Global South’s AI priorities. By focusing on democratizing access to AI, developing contextual frameworks, and balancing risks with safety, India can strengthen its global leadership in AI governance.</p> <p><div class="highlight">Successfully advancing these priorities will position India as an ideal host for the next AI Action Summit, solidifying its role as a bridge between AI superpowers and developing nations.</div></p> </section></body></html>
