Key highlights include:</p> <ul> <li><div class="highlight">₹20,000 crore allocated for the development of small modular reactors, targeting five reactors by 2033.</div></li> <li>Introduction of the <strong>Research, Development, and Innovation Fund</strong> under the Department of Science and Technology (DST).</li> <li>The DST budget allocation has surged to ₹28,000 crore, which is over three times last year’s allocation and seven times the actual expenditure of 2023-24.</li> </ul> <p>Despite these impressive increases, concerns remain about the effective absorption and utilization of these funds.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Structural Challenges in India’s R&amp;D Ecosystem</h2> <p>India's R&amp;D landscape is characterized by several structural challenges that hinder its innovation potential.</p> <h3>Low Private Sector Participation</h3> <p>The private sector contributes only 36% to India’s total R&amp;D expenditure, reflecting limited engagement compared to global standards. In contrast:</p> <ul> <li>Overall R&amp;D spending in India was just 0.64% of GDP in 2020, marking the lowest level since 1995.</li> <li>Business enterprises account for approximately 40% of government R&amp;D spending.</li> <li>Public sector R&amp;D units allocate only 0.30% of their sales turnover to research, while the private sector allocates 1.46% (2020-21, DST estimates).</li> </ul> <h3>Core Issues Affecting R&amp;D Growth</h3> <p>Despite India’s strengths in technology-driven industries like fuel, metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, textiles, IT, and biotechnology, core R&amp;D returns remain insufficient due to:</p> <ul> <li>Lack of supporting infrastructure for emerging technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence.</li> <li>Absence of semiconductor fabs and chipsets critical for hardware innovation.</li> <li>Shortage of a skilled engineering workforce to drive research initiatives.</li> <li>Lack of a robust, private sector-driven innovation ecosystem.</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h2>Strategic R&amp;D Transformation</h2> <p>To overcome these challenges, India needs a comprehensive strategy that addresses both structural and operational aspects of the R&amp;D ecosystem.</p> <h3>Clear Roadmap for Fund Allocation</h3> <p>Establish transparent mechanisms for private entities to access R&amp;D funding and ensure accountability in fund disbursal.</p> <h3>Incentivizing Private Investment</h3> <p>Introduce tax benefits, grants, and subsidies to attract corporate R&amp;D participation. For instance:</p> <table border="1"> <tr> <th>Incentive</th> <th>Expected Impact</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Tax Deductions for R&amp;D Spending</td> <td>Encourage businesses to allocate more resources to research.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Grants for Startups</td> <td>Boost innovation among small and medium enterprises.</td> </tr> </table> <h3>Building Foundational Infrastructure</h3> <ul> <li>Develop semiconductor fabrication units and advanced chip manufacturing facilities.</li> <li>Expand AI and quantum computing research hubs to foster cutting-edge innovation.</li> <li>Establish world-class engineering and research institutions to nurture talent.</li> </ul> <h3>Ensuring Long-Term Industry Engagement</h3> <p>Foster strong academia-industry partnerships and encourage startup participation in R&amp;D innovation. Additionally, create regulatory frameworks that facilitate smoother technology transfers.</p> <h3>Public Accountability</h3> <div class="important"> <p>The government must quantify expected outcomes from increased funding and track its impact on national innovation metrics.</p> </div> </section> <section class="conclusion"> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The Union Budget 2025-26 represents a transformative step for India's R&amp;D ecosystem, but its success hinges on effective fund utilization and private sector participation. By addressing structural challenges and fostering a collaborative innovation environment, India can position itself as a global leader in scientific research and technological development.</p> </section></body></html>
