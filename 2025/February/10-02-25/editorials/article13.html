With a focus on sustainability, technological innovation, and infrastructure development, these reforms seek to enhance productivity and address longstanding structural challenges.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Key Initiatives in the Budget</h2> <div class="highlight">Focus on 100 Districts:</div> <p>Special emphasis on augmenting agricultural productivity, promoting sustainable farming practices, and crop diversification in 100 identified districts.</p> <div class="highlight">Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Expansion:</div> <p>Credit access increased from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, providing farmers with greater financial support to invest in modern farming techniques.</p> <div class="highlight">Pulses Mission:</div> <p>Aimed at achieving atma nirbharta (self-sufficiency) in tur, moong, and urad production, reducing dependency on imports.</p> <div class="highlight">Makhana Board in Bihar:</div> <p>Established to promote the cultivation and marketing of makhana (foxnut), boosting local economies and traditional farming.</p> <div class="highlight">High-Yielding Crop Varieties:</div> <p>Introduction of 109 climate-resilient varieties of 32 field and horticulture crops to combat climate change impacts.</p> <div class="highlight">Mission for Vegetables and Fruits:</div> <p>An allocation of Rs 500 crore to enhance production, strengthen supply chains, and boost processing industries.</p> <div class="highlight">Agriculture Infrastructure Fund:</div> <p>Allocation increased from Rs 600 crore in FY25 to Rs 900 crore in FY26 to improve post-harvest infrastructure and reduce losses.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Budget Allocation and Inflation Impact</h2> <p>Total allocation for agriculture and allied sectors stands at Rs 1.49 trillion, marking a 4% increase over the previous year. However, <div class="highlight">inflation projected at 4-5% in FY26</div> may erode the real value of this allocation.</p> <div class="important">PM-Kisan Scheme:</div> <p>Despite its significance, the allocation remains stagnant at Rs 60,000 crore since 2019, effectively declining in real terms due to inflation.</p> <div class="important">Missed Opportunity:</div> <p>The budget fails to integrate PM-Kisan with direct transfer of fertiliser subsidies, a move that could have streamlined agricultural support and increased efficiency.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Structural Challenges in Agriculture</h2> <h3>Declining Share in GDP vs. Rising Workforce Dependency</h3> <p>Agriculture's share in GDP has declined to 17.7%, while its share in the workforce has increased from 42.5% (2018-19) to 46.1% (FY24). This reverse trend highlights the <div class="highlight">inability of non-agricultural sectors to absorb surplus labour</div>, leading to depressed real wages in farming.</p> <h3>Low R&amp;D Investment</h3> <p>R&amp;D expenditure remains below 0.5% of agri-GDP, far short of the 1% required for sustainable growth. A marginal increase in R&amp;D allocation in FY26 may not be sufficient to drive significant productivity gains or enhance climate resilience.</p> <h3>MSP-Centric Policies and Crop Diversification</h3> <p>Heavy reliance on rice and wheat due to MSP procurement policies crowds out high-value crops like pulses, oilseeds, and horticulture. The <div class="highlight">lack of crop-neutral incentives</div> hinders sustainable diversification.</p> <h3>Post-Harvest Losses</h3> <p>Post-harvest losses remain significant, with fruits losing 8.1% and vegetables 7.3%, contributing to <div class="important">37% of total post-harvest losses, amounting to Rs 1.53 trillion annually</div>. Inadequate cold chains, processing facilities, and logistics infrastructure exacerbate these losses.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Global and Market Challenges</h2> <p>India faces several global and market challenges in agriculture:</p> <h3>Import Dependence</h3> <p>Shortages in pulses, oilseeds, cotton, and maize have led to a rise in imports, increasing vulnerability to global price fluctuations.</p> <h3>Fragmented Value Chains</h3> <p>Farmers receive only 30% of consumer spending on fruits and vegetables due to inefficiencies in the value chain.</p> <h3>Logistical Bottlenecks</h3> <p>Limited processing capacity and poor market linkages hinder effective price discovery and reduce farmer incomes.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Way Forward: Opportunities and Recommendations</h2> <h3>Strengthening Market Linkages</h3> <p>Integrating e-NAM with the ONDC platform can improve price discovery and reduce inefficiencies caused by middlemen. Expanding warehousing and cold storage infrastructure will be crucial to reducing post-harvest losses.</p> <h3>Promoting Labour-Intensive Sectors</h3> <p>Encouraging skill upgradation in labour-intensive sectors can help absorb surplus agricultural labour and improve productivity. Deregulating MSMEs could further boost employment outside agriculture.</p> <h3>Private Sector Participation</h3> <p>Incentivising private investment in oilseed production, processing facilities, and marketing infrastructure can enhance sector growth. Expanding the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund will attract more private capital.</p> <h3>Subsidy Rationalisation and Investment-Driven Growth</h3> <p>Shifting from subsidy-heavy interventions to investment-driven growth strategies is essential. Rationalising subsidies will free up resources for infrastructure development and R&amp;D.</p> </section> <section class="conclusion"> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>While the Union Budget 2025-26 addresses several agricultural challenges, its incremental approach may fall short of the transformational changes needed. A paradigm shift towards <div class="important">investment-driven growth, private sector participation, and technology-led efficiency improvements</div> is crucial. To make Indian agriculture more resilient and globally competitive, bold reforms in subsidy rationalisation, infrastructure development, and market linkages are imperative.</p> </section></body></html>
