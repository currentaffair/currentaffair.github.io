While freebies can offer immediate relief and support socio-economic inclusion, unchecked distribution can strain fiscal resources and hinder long-term growth. A judicious approach, focusing on targeted welfare, fiscal responsibility, and transparent governance, is essential to ensure that welfare schemes contribute to holistic development without compromising economic stability.</p> </section><html><head><link href="../../../../editorials_style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/></head></html>
