The Court directed the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports to ensure Indian players participate in the Asian Kabaddi Championship 2025, highlighting the issue of political interference in sports administration.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Why was AKFI Suspended?</h2> <p>The AKFI, headquartered in Jaipur, is responsible for regulating all forms of Kabaddi in India. It is affiliated with the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), Asian Kabaddi Federation (AKF), and International Kabaddi Federation (IKF).</p> <div class="highlight">AKFI faces allegations of opaque elections, mismanagement, and monopolization by politicians, raising concerns over nepotism and fair representation.</div> <p>Due to governance issues and the absence of an elected body, the IKF suspended AKFI, jeopardizing India's participation in international tournaments.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Supreme Court's Directive</h2> <p>The Supreme Court instructed Justice (Retd.) S.P. Garg to transfer authority to the newly elected body from the December 2023 elections. The Court emphasized the urgency for team selection and training ahead of the Asian Kabaddi Championship 2025.</p> <div class="important">The Court clarified that the transfer of authority does not imply endorsement of the AKFI elections, and related issues remain under judicial consideration.</div> </section> <section> <h2>Concerns in Sports Administration</h2> <h3>Politicization</h3> <p>Former politicians and bureaucrats dominate sports bodies, often sidelining athletes. The Supreme Court acknowledges that sports associations perform better under the leadership of sportspersons.</p> <h3>Mismanagement</h3> <p>Opaque election processes and financial irregularities plague federations like AKFI. These bodies often operate without elected governing structures, violating the National Sports Code of India 2011.</p> <h3>Lack of Accountability</h3> <p>Without clear oversight, sports bodies lack transparency. The 2010 Commonwealth Games exposed such issues, with the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) reporting financial irregularities in multiple projects.</p> <h3>Impact on Athletes</h3> <p>Administrative inefficiencies delay team selections and tournaments, directly harming athletes. Moreover, weak complaint systems leave athletes vulnerable to issues like sexual harassment.</p> </section> <section> <h2>National Sports Code of India 2011</h2> <p>The National Sports Code of India 2011 establishes guidelines for good governance in sports federations, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and athlete welfare. It mandates democratic elections and limits the tenure of office-bearers to prevent monopolization.</p> </section> <section class="conclusion"> <h2>Way Forward</h2> <h3>Regulatory Reforms</h3> <p>A central regulatory body with clear statutes and democratic principles is essential to govern all sports federations. This body should ensure transparent governance and strict oversight.</p> <h3>Empowering Athletes</h3> <p>Athletes must play active roles in decision-making processes, ensuring transparency and accountability. Adopting the Olympic Charter, which mandates athlete representation in National Olympic Committees, can serve as a model.</p> <h3>Promoting Gender Equality</h3> <p>Increasing women's representation in sports administration through quotas and safe, inclusive environments is crucial for balanced governance.</p> </section></body></html>
