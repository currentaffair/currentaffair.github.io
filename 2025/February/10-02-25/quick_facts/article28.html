Over the last decade, India received around <strong>USD 1.5 billion</strong>, accounting for <strong>0.2% to 0.4%</strong> of USAID’s total global funding.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h2>Implications for India</h2> <p><strong>Global Role:</strong> India positions itself as a bridge between the <strong>Global North and South</strong>, leveraging its G20 status.</p> <p><strong>Geopolitical Impact:</strong> Reduced US influence in G20 could allow <strong>China and Russia</strong> to expand their roles, potentially weakening India’s position.</p> <p><strong>Healthcare Concerns:</strong> While direct financial aid to India has decreased, USAID contributions exceeded <strong>USD 50 million</strong> in 2024. Permanent cuts could impact <span class="highlight">vaccination programs</span>, <span class="highlight">infectious disease control</span>, and <span class="highlight">medical infrastructure</span>.</p> <p>India may need to <strong>redirect domestic funds</strong> to sustain projects in health, environment, and governance.</p> </div> <footer>        Tags: usaid, foreign-aid, india-healthcare, g20, international-relations, global-south, humanitarian-aid </footer></body></html>
