Ethanol, derived from plant materials, boosts octane levels, improving engine performance and combustion efficiency.</p> <h2>India’s Ethanol Blending Target</h2> <p>India aims for <span class="highlight">20% ethanol blending</span>, achieving this a year earlier than planned. This requires <strong>1,100 crore litres</strong> of fuel ethanol annually.</p> <h2>Economic Impact</h2> <p>Producing <strong>100 crore litres</strong> of ethanol saves <strong>Rs 6,000 crore</strong> in oil imports. India's oil import bill is approximately <span class="highlight">₹10.5 lakh crore</span>.</p> <h2>Sources of Ethanol Production</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Sugar and Molasses</strong>: Contribute around <strong>400 crore litres</strong>.</li> <li><strong>FCI Rice</strong>: Expected to produce <strong>110 crore litres</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Maize</strong>: Contributes nearly <strong>400 crore litres</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Broken Rice</strong>: Supplementary source for ethanol production.</li> </ul> <h2>Key Details</h2> <p>India’s ethanol distillery capacity stands at <strong>1,600 crore litres</strong>, bolstered by government incentives. The price of <strong>FCI rice</strong> has been reduced to <strong>₹22.5 per kg</strong> to support ethanol production.</p> <h2>Maize's Role in Ethanol Production</h2> <p>Maize has become a significant ethanol feedstock with <strong>42 million tonnes</strong> produced in 2024-25. Major maize-producing states include <strong>Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar,</strong> and <strong>Uttar Pradesh</strong>.</p> <h2>Addressing Concerns</h2> <p>The byproduct of ethanol production, <strong>Distiller’s Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS)</strong>, is used as poultry feed, ensuring traditional uses of maize are maintained.</p> <h2>Way Forward</h2> <p>Balancing ethanol production with food security is crucial. Continuous monitoring and policy adjustments are necessary to ensure sustainability.</p> </div></body></html>
