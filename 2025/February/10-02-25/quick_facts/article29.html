At least five reactors are expected to be operational by 2033.</p> <h2>Budget Allocations</h2> <p>The <strong>Department of Atomic Energy</strong> has been allocated <span class="highlight">₹24,049 crore</span> for 2025-26, slightly lower than the <strong>₹24,450 crore</strong> expected by March 2024 and significantly less than <strong>₹25,882 crore</strong> in 2023-24.</p> <h2>About Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)</h2> <p><strong>SMRs</strong> are advanced nuclear reactors with smaller capacity, offering flexibility, lower costs, and enhanced safety. They are key to India’s goal of achieving <span class="highlight">100 GW</span> of nuclear energy by 2047.</p> <h2>BSR vs BSMR</h2> <p><strong>Bharat Small Reactors (BSR)</strong> are modified versions of existing Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), while <strong>Bharat Small Modular Reactors (BSMR)</strong> are new technologies in the development phase.</p> <h2>Private Sector Role</h2> <p>The government plans to partner with the private sector for setting up BSRs, R&amp;D of BSMRs, and new nuclear technologies. This is a shift from the traditional government-only model.</p> <h2>Development and Operation</h2> <p>BSRs will be built and operated by the <strong>Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. (NPCIL)</strong>, with private sector financing.</p> <h2>Long-Term Goals</h2> <p>India aims to expand nuclear energy capacity from <span class="highlight">7 GW</span> to <span class="highlight">100 GW</span> by 2047. To achieve this, amendments to the <strong>Atomic Energy Act</strong> and <strong>Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act</strong> are planned to encourage private sector involvement.</p> </div></body></html>
