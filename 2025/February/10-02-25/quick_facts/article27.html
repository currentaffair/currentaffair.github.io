Dual-entry gates and 360-degree surveillance ensure staff safety and prevent escapes.</p> <h2>Health Monitoring</h2> <p>Cheetahs will be quarantined for at least one month before release into a <strong>64 sq km</strong> enclosure. Continuous observation will mitigate health risks from new diseases.</p> <h2>Historical &amp; Geographical Significance</h2> <p>The sanctuary's <span class="highlight">savanna-like habitat</span> mirrors African environments. Rock art at <strong>Chaturbhuj Nala</strong> suggests cheetahs' historical presence in the region.</p> <h2>Local Displacement &amp; Concerns</h2> <p><strong>Karanpura village</strong> (280 families) was relocated, facing resistance and compensation issues. Nearby villages, including <strong>Gurjar, Banjara,</strong> and <strong>Bhil</strong> communities, suffer from <span class="highlight">water scarcity</span> as fencing blocks access to the Chambal river, affecting dairy farming and reducing milk production.</p> <h2>Challenges &amp; Future Implications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Human-Wildlife Conflict</strong>: Balancing local displacement with conservation goals.</li> <li><strong>Ecological Balance</strong>: Maintaining prey populations without harming biodiversity.</li> <li><strong>Sustainable Development</strong>: Addressing local grievances while ensuring conservation success.</li> </ul> </div></body></html>
