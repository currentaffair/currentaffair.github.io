Despite spending ₹13 lakh crore on modernization in the last decade, <span class="highlight">returns remain underwhelming</span>.</p> <p>Indian Railways' operational costs are not covered by its earnings, requiring continued <strong>government financial support</strong>.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h2>Key Announcements and Measures</h2> <p><strong>Infrastructure and Connectivity:</strong> Focus on station modernization, train upgrades, and increasing connectivity. Since 2014, <strong>150 km of new tracks</strong> have been laid annually, up from 113 km in the previous decade.</p> <p><strong>Safety:</strong> ₹1,16,514 crore allocated for safety initiatives. However, no expansion of the <span class="highlight">Kavach Safety System</span> beyond 1,465 km for 2025-26.</p> <p><strong>Electrification:</strong> Electrification rate improved to <strong>294 Rkms/year</strong> from 18 Rkms/year before 2014. India aims to become the world's first <span class="highlight">fully electrified railway network</span>, though most electricity still comes from fossil fuels.</p> <p><strong>Vande Bharat Trains:</strong> 200 new trains announced, but without a clear timeline. Major projects like the <strong>Western Dedicated Freight Corridor</strong> and <strong>Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail</strong> remain unaddressed.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h2>Concerns and Criticisms</h2> <p><strong>Station Redevelopment:</strong> Projects stalled with visible progress only at select stations like Gandhinagar and Ayodhya. The <strong>New Delhi Station</strong> project faces delays due to repeated re-tendering.</p> <p><strong>High-Speed Rail Network:</strong> Vision to build a <strong>7,000 km network</strong> by 2047 lacks a clear strategy or timeline.</p> <p><strong>Freight Growth:</strong> Ambition to become the <span class="highlight">world’s second-largest freight carrier</span> (1.6 billion tonnes) lacks context. No clear plan to reclaim eroding freight share or improve passenger comfort and train speeds.</p> </div> <footer>        Tags: indian-railways, capex, infrastructure, electrification, vande-bharat, high-speed-rail </footer></body></html>
