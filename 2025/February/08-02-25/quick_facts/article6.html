These judges must serve on a Bench led by a sitting judge.</p> <p>The <span class="highlight">Lok Prahari (2021)</span> rule, which limited such appointments to High Courts with more than 20% judicial vacancies, has been relaxed. However, the number of ad-hoc judges is capped at <strong>10% of the High Court's sanctioned strength</strong> (typically 2 to 5 judges).</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h2>Historical Context of Ad-Hoc Appointments</h2> <ul> <li><strong>1972</strong>: Justice Suraj Bhan appointed to Madhya Pradesh High Court (election petitions).</li> <li><strong>1982</strong>: Justice P. Venugopal appointed to Madras High Court.</li> <li><strong>2007</strong>: Justice O.P. Srivastava appointed to Allahabad High Court (Ayodhya title suits).</li> </ul> </div> <div class="section"> <h2>Constitutional Provision: Article 224-A</h2> <p>Introduced via the <strong>15th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1963</strong>, <span class="highlight">Article 224-A</span> permits the appointment of retired judges to High Courts on an ad-hoc basis. This requires the consent of both the retired judge and the President of India. Ad-hoc judges have the same powers and privileges as sitting judges, with remuneration determined by a Presidential order.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h2>Reason for the New Order</h2> <p>With <strong>62 lakh cases pending</strong> in High Courts as of <span class="highlight">January 25, 2024</span>—including <strong>18.2 lakh criminal cases</strong>—the Supreme Court removed the 20% vacancy requirement to expedite judicial processes. Ad-hoc judges are restricted to handling criminal appeals to ensure faster case resolutions.</p> </div></body></html>
