This decision follows the Union Budget 2025-26, which reduced personal income taxes to stimulate consumption and revitalize economic growth amidst a slowdown.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Factors Behind the Repo Rate Cut</h2> <h3>Growth-Stimulating Budget</h3> <p>The Union Budget 2025-26 introduced personal income tax cuts and revised Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) limits, increasing disposable income. The repo rate cut complements these fiscal measures by reducing borrowing costs and sustaining demand.</p> <h3>Declining Inflation</h3> <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) eased to 5.22% in December 2024 from 5.48% in November, providing the RBI room for monetary easing.</p> <h3>Enhanced Market Liquidity</h3> <p>The RBI injected Rs 1.5 trillion into the banking system to improve liquidity, easing credit markets. The repo rate cut ensures continued liquidity and lower interest rates, boosting economic growth.</p> <h3>Global Economic Uncertainty</h3> <p>Recent US tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China sparked trade war fears, weakening the rupee to 87.29 per dollar and raising inflation risks. The repo rate cut aims to cushion the impact of these external shocks and support domestic growth.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Understanding the Repo Rate</h2> <h3>Definition and Purpose</h3> <p>Repo rate is the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the central bank to meet short-term liquidity needs. Banks provide securities as collateral and agree to repurchase them later at a higher price, including interest.</p> <h3>Impact on Borrowing Costs</h3> <div class="highlight"> <p>Higher repo rate leads to costlier loans for banks, resulting in higher interest rates for consumers and businesses, which slows borrowing and spending.</p> <p>Lower repo rate makes loans cheaper for banks, reducing interest rates for borrowers and encouraging borrowing and spending.</p> </div> <h3>Role in Monetary Policy</h3> <p>The repo rate is a key tool for controlling money supply, inflation, and economic growth.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Implications of the Repo Rate Cut</h2> <h3>Economic Growth</h3> <p>Lower borrowing costs enable businesses to expand and invest, leading to increased production and job creation. Reduced interest rates make loans cheaper, lowering EMIs and boosting borrowing and spending.</p> <h3>Strengthening Financial Markets</h3> <p>Banks may reduce interest rates on savings accounts and fixed deposits, making traditional savings less attractive. This shift may drive consumers toward investments in stocks, mutual funds, or real estate.</p> <h3>Export Competitiveness</h3> <p>A lower repo rate may reduce investment returns, leading to capital outflows and a weakened currency. While this raises import costs, it enhances export competitiveness.</p> <h3>Inflation Risks</h3> <div class="important"> <p>Increased spending from lower borrowing costs may push up prices and inflation over time, potentially breaching the RBI's inflation target of 4% (within a band of +/- 2%).</p> </div> </section> <section> <h2>Background of the 4% Inflation Target</h2> <h3>Chakravarty Committee (1982-85)</h3> <p>The Chakravarty Committee, set up under RBI Governor Manmohan Singh, emphasized price stability as a core objective of monetary policy. It proposed a 4% average annual inflation target in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) to balance economic priorities.</p> <table> <tr> <th>Recommendation</th> <th>Details</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Price Stability</td> <td>Emphasized as a primary objective of monetary policy.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Inflation Target</td> <td>Proposed 4% average annual inflation in WPI.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Government Borrowing</td> <td>Recommended market-driven borrowing to reduce reliance on RBI funding.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Monetary Targeting</td> <td>Advocated M3 money supply control to manage inflation.</td> </tr> </table> <h3>Urjit Patel Committee (2014)</h3> <p>This committee formalized inflation targeting, setting the 4% target (±2% band) first proposed by the Chakravarty Committee. India's inflation targeting framework, adopted in 2016, aligns with global best practices.</p> </section> <section class="conclusion"> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The RBI’s repo rate cut aims to boost economic growth by lowering borrowing costs. However, it may lead to inflationary pressures, challenging the 4% target set by the RBI MPC. Balancing growth and price stability remains crucial, especially amidst global economic uncertainties.</p> </section></body></html>
