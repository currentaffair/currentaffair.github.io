This pivot reflects growing concerns over the inadequacy of global climate commitments and the insufficient financial support from developed nations. This shift was underscored at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties 29 (COP29), where India voiced its frustration over the lack of meaningful progress and financial backing from wealthier nations.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Reasons Behind India’s Adaptation Focus</h2> <h3>Global Climate Commitment Reevaluation</h3> <p>Despite global agreements, the world is not on track to meet emissions reduction targets for 2030 or 2035. Developed nations have consistently failed to meet their climate finance obligations, securing only <div class="important">USD 300 billion per year starting 2035</div>, far below the <div class="highlight">USD 1 trillion demanded by developing nations</div>. Additionally, the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement in 2025 has weakened global momentum, prompting India to seek a more autonomous approach to its climate strategy.</p> <h3>Immediate and Local Benefits</h3> <p>India argues that global climate targets often overlook the immediate needs of developing nations. Unlike mitigation efforts, which require broad international cooperation, adaptation strategies such as <div class="highlight">building climate-resilient infrastructure</div> offer direct, tangible benefits at the local level.</p> <h3>Economic Growth Prioritization</h3> <p>The <em>Economic Survey 2024-25</em> suggests that achieving developed nation status by 2047 should be a priority. This would enable India to undertake a more sustainable transition to clean energy in the future. India’s rapid industrialization is seen as a crucial step towards building the resources necessary for long-term decarbonization, similar to China’s model of development.</p> <h3>Flexibility in Energy Transition</h3> <p>India seeks greater autonomy in determining its pace of energy transition. While the country remains committed to decarbonization as a long-term goal, it is unwilling to compromise economic growth through immediate restrictions on fossil fuel use. A <div class="highlight">bottom-up approach</div>, emphasizing ground-level initiatives, is seen as more effective than top-down mandates.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Understanding Adaptation, Mitigation, and Resilience</h2> <table border="1"> <tr> <th>Term</th> <th>Definition</th> <th>Examples of Actions</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Mitigation</td> <td>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit climate change impacts.</td> <td>                    Transitioning to low-carbon energy sources,<br/>                    Using carbon capture technologies,<br/>                    Protecting forests and oceans as carbon sinks,                    Promoting sustainable behaviors. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Adaptation</td> <td>Adjusting to climate change effects to minimize harm or leverage benefits.</td> <td>                    Building sea-level rise defenses,<br/>                    Protecting infrastructure from extreme weather,<br/>                    Diversifying crops,<br/>                    Reducing food waste. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Resilience</td> <td>Enhancing the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to climate impacts.</td> <td>                    Developing early warning systems,<br/>                    Increasing urban green spaces,<br/>                    Planting trees to mitigate urban heat. </td> </tr> </table> </section> <section> <h2>India’s Balance Between Growth and Clean Energy</h2> <h3>Low-Carbon Development</h3> <p>India is expanding its renewable energy sector while resisting strict coal phase-down commitments. The country is on track to meet its 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), aiming for <div class="highlight">50% installed electricity capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030</div>. As of November 2024, India achieved <div class="important">46.8%</div>.</p> <h3>Renewable Energy and Carbon Sink Goals</h3> <p>India aims to create an additional 2.5-3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide sink through forest expansion by 2030. According to the <em>Forest Survey of India (2024)</em>, the carbon sink stood at 30.43 billion tonnes in 2023, up from 28.14 billion tonnes in 2005. Projections indicate this will reach <div class="important">31.71 billion tonnes by 2030</div>, surpassing the NDC target.</p> <h3>Domestic Clean Energy Production</h3> <p>India is reducing its reliance on foreign supply chains for clean energy technologies through the <div class="highlight">National Manufacturing Mission</div>, announced in the <em>Union Budget 2025-26</em>. This includes support for the indigenous production of solar cells, wind turbines, and battery storage solutions.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Key Climate Adaptation Initiatives in India</h2> <h3>National Adaptation Plan (NAP)</h3> <p>The NAP, developed by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It focuses on building climate resilience across sectors such as agriculture, water management, and urban planning.</p> <h3>Adaptation in Agriculture</h3> <p>India is implementing measures like <div class="highlight">climate-resilient seeds</div>, improved soil health practices, groundwater conservation, and modified cropping techniques to combat heat and water stress threats to food security.</p> <h3>Urban Climate Resilience</h3> <p>The National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (NMSH) promotes waste and water management and green buildings, while <div class="highlight">AMRUT 2.0</div> focuses on tackling urban flooding.</p> <h3>Coastal Adaptation Measures</h3> <p>The <div class="highlight">Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats &amp; Tangible Incomes (MISHTI)</div> aims to restore 540 sq. km of mangroves across nine coastal states. This is expected to sequester 4.5 million tons of carbon and create 22.8 million jobs.</p> <h3>Water Resource Management</h3> <p>The <em>Jal Shakti Abhiyan</em> emphasizes rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and afforestation efforts to strengthen water resource management.</p> </section> <section class="conclusion"> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>India's shift from mitigation to adaptation represents a pragmatic approach to climate action, balancing the nation's developmental needs with environmental sustainability. By focusing on localized, immediate benefits and fostering economic growth, India aims to build resilience against climate change while maintaining flexibility in its energy transition. The success of this strategy will depend on continued innovation, robust policy frameworks, and meaningful international cooperation.</p> </section></body></html>
