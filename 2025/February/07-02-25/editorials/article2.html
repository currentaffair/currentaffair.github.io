This amendment affects approximately 20 GW of thermal power capacity located in densely populated areas.</p> <p><div class="highlight">This decision continues a long-standing trend of extending emission compliance deadlines, dating back to the initial notification in 2015.</div></p> </section> <section> <h2>Evolution of Emission Norms</h2> <p>In December 2015, the MoEFCC introduced stringent norms for thermal power plants, including limits on particulate matter (PM), SO<sub>2</sub>, and other emissions. Initially, compliance was required by December 2017, but multiple extensions have followed.</p> <p>The norms were designed to align with international standards from countries like China, Australia, and the US, which have shown significant improvements in air quality through strict emission controls.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Challenges and Delays</h2> <h3>Debate on Implementation Strategies</h3> <p>Indian coal has lower sulphur content, which theoretically should make compliance easier. However, the high cost and logistical challenges of implementing Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) systems have shifted the debate. FGDs, while effective, were never explicitly mandated, leading to varied implementation strategies across regions.</p> <h3>Government Agencies' Conflicting Views</h3> <p>The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in its 2020 and 2021 reports questioned the necessity of uniform SO<sub>2</sub> norms and proposed a phased approach extending to 2035. Conversely, a 2022 study by IIT Delhi found that while FGDs improve air quality, concerns about high costs, supply chain issues, and increased coal consumption complicate their adoption.</p> <p>A 2024 study by CSIR-NEERI, commissioned by NITI Aayog, argued that SO<sub>2</sub> norms are less critical for air quality improvement compared to particulate matter (PM) emissions, highlighting the need for a balanced approach.</p> <h3>Multiple Deadline Extensions</h3> <p>The December 2024 amendment marks the fourth extension of the compliance deadlines. Deadlines now vary by location, emission type, and plant category. <div class="important">Despite SO<sub>2</sub> deadlines being pushed to 2027, deadlines for PM and other emissions were set for December 2024.</div></p> </section> <section> <h2>Financial and Environmental Consequences</h2> <h3>Consumer Cost Burden</h3> <p>Many power plants have already tendered FGDs, passing the costs onto consumers through electricity tariff adjustments. Even when installed, FGDs may not be utilized consistently to avoid increasing power generation costs, leading to economic inefficiencies.</p> <h3>Health and Environmental Impact</h3> <p>Prolonged SO<sub>2</sub> emissions contribute to acid rain, respiratory illnesses, and secondary aerosol formation. <div class="important">The extension means people living near thermal plants will continue to suffer from deteriorating air quality.</div></p> <h3>Regulatory Gaps</h3> <p>Pollution control boards' enforcement of existing norms remains inconsistent and unclear. There is a lack of publicly available data to verify compliance, undermining transparency and accountability.</p> </section> <section class="conclusion"> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>There is a growing urgency to address SO<sub>2</sub> emissions alongside other air pollutants. <div class="highlight">Extending deadlines may not provide a sustainable solution to the issue.</div> A comprehensive analysis of the situation, considering economic, environmental, and health impacts, is essential before further steps are taken.</p> </section></body></html>
