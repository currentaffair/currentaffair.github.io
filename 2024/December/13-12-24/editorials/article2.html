    Insurance isn’t enough: Universal Health Coverage (UHC) must guarantee care
</header>

<div class="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is based on the fundamental principle that every human being deserves access to good health and dignity. Achieving UHC is not just about health insurance; it requires a political and governance system that values equality and justice as its core principles. To ensure that UHC becomes a reality, India must address several systemic challenges while aligning health policy with the welfare of its people.</p>

    <h2>Challenges in Achieving Universal Health Coverage</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Insufficient Public Health Funding</h3>
        <p>India’s public health expenditure remains insufficient, averaging only 1-1.2% of GDP, significantly lower than the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended 3%. This gap results in a high reliance on out-of-pocket expenditures, which account for 45-54% of total health spending. This is well above the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 20%, placing an undue burden on the population.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Resource Gaps in Human Capital</h3>
        <p>Human resource shortages are another key challenge, particularly in public healthcare facilities. For instance, India faces an alarming 80% vacancy rate for specialists at Community Health Centres (CHCs). This shortage results in overcrowded district hospitals, which forces many people to seek costly private care, further increasing financial strain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Private Sector Dominance</h3>
        <p>The increasing corporatisation and commercialisation of healthcare have led to rising costs. High capital investments in tertiary hospitals, often driven by equity and venture capital firms, create pressure for high returns—sometimes over 25%. As a result, excessive diagnostics and unnecessary surgeries have become more common. Additionally, the privatization of district hospitals has further limited access to affordable healthcare for middle-class populations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Poor Governance and Accountability</h3>
        <p>The governance systems in place lack robust mechanisms to enforce quality care and regulate the private sector. Government programs such as Ayushman Bharat primarily focus on health insurance, neglecting foundational improvements in the system itself, such as better healthcare infrastructure and accountability in service delivery.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Way Forward: Policy Recommendations</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Increase Health Funding</h3>
        <p>To align with WHO norms, health funding must be doubled to bridge the significant gaps in primary healthcare. Sustainable financing for public health infrastructure should be prioritized, ensuring equitable access to healthcare services for all citizens.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Address Social Determinants of Health</h3>
        <p>Universal access to adequate nutrition, safe water, and environmental hygiene is essential for improving health outcomes. Addressing these social determinants will play a crucial role in advancing UHC.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Strengthen Human Resources</h3>
        <p>Investing in training and skill development for healthcare professionals at all levels is essential. Additionally, reforms are needed in the incentive structures to attract specialists to underserved areas, ensuring that care is accessible in rural and remote regions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Enhance Governance of Health Systems</h3>
        <p>Creating strong accountability mechanisms for both public and private healthcare providers will ensure that healthcare quality remains high. Enforcement of laws to protect patients from exploitation in the healthcare market is essential to maintain trust and equity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Revamp Healthcare Delivery Systems</h3>
        <p>Investing in community-based primary healthcare systems, led by family doctors and public health specialists, will significantly improve access and quality. Furthermore, laws and regulations should address modifiable lifestyle factors that contribute to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), helping to reduce long-term healthcare burdens.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Role of Ayushman Bharat</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Positive Contributions</h3>
        <p>A key success of Ayushman Bharat has been strengthening primary healthcare facilities, improving access to drugs and medical personnel. The scheme also provides health insurance to 50 crore poor citizens, offering financial protection against catastrophic health expenditures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>While Ayushman Bharat has made strides in improving access to healthcare, it fails to address systemic issues such as the poor quality of care, lack of accountability, and inequitable access to services. Insurance-based models cannot be effective without addressing the underlying weaknesses in the public healthcare system.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Viewing Universal Health Coverage merely as the provision of health insurance is a flawed perspective. UHC requires a holistic approach, one that strengthens the healthcare system itself through better governance, increased funding, and an emphasis on human resources. India’s ability to achieve UHC hinges on its political alignment with people’s welfare, ensuring that health becomes a fundamental right for all citizens, not just an insurance policy.</p>
