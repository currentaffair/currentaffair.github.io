            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>On January 1, 2025, Pakistan will assume a two-year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), marking its eighth term. This period is notable because half of the 10 elected members of the UNSC will be from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Pakistan's focus is likely to be on its strategic interests, particularly with Afghanistan, India, and global terrorism concerns.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Pakistan’s Priorities in UNSC</h2>
            <p>Pakistan's entry into the UNSC comes at a time when geopolitical tensions in regions like Afghanistan and Gaza are escalating. Pakistan is expected to focus on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Afghanistan:</strong> Strengthening ties with the Taliban, with backing from China and Russia.</li>
                <li><strong>Gaza Conflict:</strong> Pushing for a ceasefire to stabilize the region with OIC support.</li>
                <li><strong>Peacekeeping:</strong> Emphasizing its role as a major contributor of peacekeeping troops.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on India:</strong> An anti-India narrative remains central to Pakistan's UNSC strategy, as it seeks to label India as a "state sponsor of terrorism."</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What India Should Expect</h2>
            <p>India must anticipate multiple anti-India initiatives by Pakistan during its UNSC term, which may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Push on Kashmir:</strong> Pakistan is likely to continue advocating for discussions on Jammu and Kashmir, despite India’s firm stance against UNSC involvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-India Propaganda:</strong> Expect efforts to label India as a perpetrator of terrorism while deflecting Pakistan's own involvement.</li>
                <li><strong>China’s Support:</strong> China’s strategic partnership with Pakistan will likely provide diplomatic backing for anti-India resolutions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Role of China</h2>
            <p>China, a permanent member of the UNSC, will play a pivotal role in supporting Pakistan's anti-India agenda. China's actions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geopolitical Alliance:</strong> China’s support will help Pakistan counterbalance India’s influence in multilateral forums.</li>
                <li><strong>Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK):</strong> China, which occupies part of PoK, will back Pakistan’s claims in the region to further its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Islamophobia and Terrorism in UNSC</h2>
            <p>Pakistan has attempted to use Islamophobia as a tool to justify terrorism, a strategy it has tried to introduce into UNSC discussions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linking Islamophobia to Terrorism:</strong> Pakistan sought to use Islamophobia to justify terrorist actions, but India successfully blocked these attempts.</li>
                <li><strong>UN Special Envoy on Islamophobia:</strong> Despite India's resistance, Pakistan succeeded in pushing for a UN special envoy on Islamophobia in 2024.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Challenges Ahead for Pakistan</h2>
            <p>Pakistan’s internal challenges, including political instability and economic struggles, hinder its ability to engage effectively in multilateral diplomacy. Despite this, Pakistan’s focus on India will remain a significant challenge for India’s diplomatic strategy in the UNSC.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While Pakistan's entry into the UNSC presents challenges, especially concerning its anti-India rhetoric, its internal issues will limit its effectiveness. India's robust diplomatic responses, backed by strategic alliances, will be crucial in countering Pakistan’s initiatives and safeguarding India’s interests in the UNSC.</p>
