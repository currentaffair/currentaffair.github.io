            <p class="section-content">
                India's journey towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has been marked by significant challenges and incremental progress. While India has implemented various health schemes since 1948, it still faces substantial hurdles in achieving true UHC. Despite efforts, only 41% of Indian households have health insurance, and a significant proportion of the population avoids government health facilities due to poor care quality. The road ahead demands a focused approach that prioritizes reducing health inequalities, improving service quality, and ensuring consistent health outcomes across all socioeconomic groups and regions.

            <div class="section-title">Current Status of India's Healthcare Sector</div>
            <p class="section-content">
                The healthcare sector in India reached a valuation of US$ 372 billion in 2023, employing 7.5 million people. This sector has seen significant growth, particularly in telemedicine, health-tech, and medical tourism. The Indian hospital market, valued at US$ 98.98 billion in 2023, is projected to double by 2032. The telemedicine market is anticipated to grow to US$ 5.4 billion by 2025, and the e-health market could reach US$ 10.6 billion in the same period. 
                <div class="important-points">
                    India’s doctor-to-population ratio stands at 1:854, which includes both allopathic and AYUSH practitioners. Additionally, medical tourism has positioned India as a global hub, contributing US$ 7.69 billion in 2024 and projected to grow to US$ 14.31 billion by 2029.

            <div class="section-title">Challenges Hindering Universal Health Coverage</div>
            <p class="section-content">
                Despite India's progress, several barriers hinder achieving UHC. These include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inadequate Public Health Expenditure and Weak Primary Healthcare System:</strong> India spends only 1.9% of its GDP on healthcare, focusing heavily on tertiary care rather than primary healthcare, leading to higher disease burdens and escalating costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regional Disparities in Healthcare Access:</strong> Urban areas have significantly better healthcare access than rural areas, despite the fact that 65% of India’s population lives in rural regions.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Burden of Non-Communicable Diseases:</strong> NCDs such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers account for 65-66% of total deaths in India (WHO, 2022), increasing the strain on an already overburdened healthcare system.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="highlight">
                    Air pollution alone caused 1.67 million deaths in India in 2019, exacerbating health inequalities.

            <div class="section-title">Measures to Accelerate Universal Health Coverage</div>
            <p class="section-content">
                To overcome these challenges, India can adopt several measures:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enhancing Public Health Expenditure:</strong> India needs to increase its healthcare spending to at least 2.5% of GDP by 2025, as recommended by the National Health Policy, 2017. This would support infrastructure, workforce, and medicines at public facilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strengthening Primary Healthcare:</strong> Expanding primary healthcare centers (PHCs) with better staffing, equipment, and medicines is vital. Programs like Ayushman Bharat must focus more on preventive care and the management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Leveraging Digital Health Technology:</strong> Expanding digital health platforms like Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) can streamline patient records and improve healthcare delivery across India, especially in rural areas.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Conclusion</div>
            <p class="section-content">
                While India has made considerable strides in its pursuit of Universal Health Coverage, substantial challenges remain, including inadequate public health expenditure, regional disparities, poor insurance penetration, and an overburdened healthcare system. To achieve UHC, India must enhance public health spending, strengthen primary healthcare systems, and address inefficiencies in government schemes. There is also a need for better coordination between the central and state governments to overcome fragmentation in healthcare policies.
