        India's Economic Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        
        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Indian economy, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, was already facing significant structural challenges. With economic growth rates dwindling and systemic issues mounting, the government took a series of supply-side measures, including corporate tax cuts. However, the pandemic's disruption exacerbated these issues. This article examines the pre- and post-pandemic economic scenarios in India, the structural challenges faced, and the road to economic recovery. We also explore global economic trends that influence India's economic prospects.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Pre-COVID Economic Scenario -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Pre-COVID Economic Scenario</h2>
            <h3>Challenges Before the Pandemic</h3>
            <p>Before the pandemic hit, India’s economy was already grappling with a slowdown. GDP growth fell from 8.2% in March 2018 to just 3.1% in March 2020. This marked a continued decline over eight quarters, indicating deeper structural issues. The economy’s resilience was further tested by global trade disruptions, internal market inefficiencies, and inadequate reforms.</p>
            <h3>Government's Response: Supply-Side Measures</h3>
            <p>In response to the slowdown, the government implemented supply-side measures, such as corporate tax cuts in late 2019. This initiative aimed to stimulate corporate profits, attract investments, and boost employment. However, it resulted in a substantial revenue loss of ₹1.5 lakh crore. While corporate profits surged, the trickle-down effect on workers was minimal, with wages stagnating amidst rising profits.</p>

        <!-- Pandemic Disruption and Recovery -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Pandemic Disruption and Economic Recovery</h2>
            <h3>The Impact of COVID-19</h3>
            <p>Before the impact of tax cuts could take hold, the COVID-19 pandemic caused severe disruptions. The RBI's monetary policy played a key role in limiting the damage by lowering interest rates and ensuring liquidity in the economy. Despite these efforts, the Indian economy experienced a sharp contraction in the first quarter of the pandemic.</p>
            <h3>Post-Pandemic Rebound</h3>
            <p>Following the lockdown, India saw a brief but powerful economic rebound, driven by pent-up demand, often referred to as "revenge consumption." This phase witnessed a surge in consumer spending fueled by accumulated savings during the pandemic. However, as the economy faced structural inefficiencies and supply chain bottlenecks, growth began to slow down again by 2024.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Economic Slowdown in 2024 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Recent Economic Developments (2024)</h2>
            <h3>GDP Growth and Key Indicators</h3>
            <p>India’s economy experienced a sharp slowdown in 2024, with GDP growth falling to 5.4% in Q2 FY24, the lowest in seven quarters. Manufacturing and export growth also showed signs of weakness. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained above 6%, limiting the RBI’s ability to lower interest rates further. Key sectors like private consumption, government expenditure, and fixed capital formation showed mixed results.</p>
            <h3>Private and Government Consumption</h3>
            <p>Private consumption grew by only 6%, while government consumption saw a marginal increase of 4.4%. However, this remains low compared to pre-pandemic years, where consumption was a major driver of growth. Investment in infrastructure and capital formation showed a decline, signaling potential issues with future economic growth.</p>

        <!-- Structural Challenges in India's Economic Policy -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Structural Challenges in India's Economic Policy</h2>
            <h3>Corporate-Oriented Policies</h3>
            <p>India’s economic policy has been predominantly focused on corporate incentives. Corporate tax cuts, while aimed at stimulating investment, have not translated into meaningful benefits for workers or the economy at large. The tax cuts resulted in corporate profits quadrupling in just four years, but the benefits failed to reach the broader workforce. Wage stagnation, despite higher corporate profits, and the increasing informalisation of the labor market have exacerbated income inequality.</p>
            <h3>Issues with the Workforce and Employment</h3>
            <p>India’s labor market is also plagued by an increasing shift towards informal employment, which further depresses wages and limits the overall demand in the economy. As highlighted by the Chief Economic Adviser, this trend contributes to a vicious cycle where low wages suppress consumption, which in turn hinders economic recovery.</p>

        <!-- Policy Recommendations -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Balancing Policy Measures: Supply-Side vs Demand-Side</h2>
            <h3>Need for a Balanced Approach</h3>
            <p>In light of the ongoing slowdown, there is an urgent need for demand-side policy interventions. While supply-side measures, like tax cuts and incentives for investment, are necessary, they must be complemented by policies that stimulate domestic demand. This can be achieved through wage growth, job creation, and targeted fiscal policies aimed at boosting consumption.</p>
            <h3>Key Recommendations</h3>
            <p>Some key recommendations include increasing corporate wage share, addressing informalization of labor, and introducing fiscal policies to support MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises), which are vital to job creation and local economic growth.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Conclusion Section -->
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>India’s economic slowdown highlights the challenges of relying solely on supply-side policies. A more inclusive approach is necessary—one that balances the need for corporate investment with the imperative of demand-side stimulus, such as wage growth, job creation, and support for the informal sector. By focusing on domestic consumption and investments, India can pave the way for sustainable and inclusive economic growth.</p>
