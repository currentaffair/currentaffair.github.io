    Sri Lankan President Dissanayake’s India Visit: Strengthening Bilateral Ties
</header>

<div class="content">
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s visit to India marks an important milestone in the bilateral relationship between the two countries. As his first overseas trip since assuming office, this visit comes at a crucial moment, allowing both nations to strengthen their diplomatic, economic, and strategic ties. The visit sets the stage for greater cooperation in various sectors, particularly in addressing longstanding challenges and fostering mutual growth.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Political Stability in Sri Lanka</h2>
        <p>Dissanayake’s coalition, the National People’s Power (NPP), enjoys a decisive majority in Sri Lanka’s legislature, granting him a strong mandate to address national issues. This political stability offers a promising opportunity for Sri Lanka to resolve past governance challenges, which had previously hindered effective decision-making. The robust political backing for the government positions Sri Lanka to fulfill its domestic commitments and pursue stronger diplomatic and economic engagement with India.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Key Areas of Economic Cooperation</h2>
        <h3>Continuation of IMF Programme</h3>
        <p>Sri Lanka has committed to continuing its economic recovery efforts, with a particular focus on welfare spending to address the country’s fiscal challenges. The IMF-backed programme is central to this effort, providing a framework for macroeconomic stability while ensuring that essential public services are maintained. India has expressed its support for Sri Lanka’s recovery process, recognizing the importance of sustained economic stability for regional prosperity.</p>

        <h3>Free Trade Agreement (FTA)</h3>
        <p>Discussions on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between India and Sri Lanka are set to resume, aiming to boost bilateral trade and investment. An FTA would significantly enhance trade flows, particularly in sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and services, benefitting both economies. This renewed focus on trade is a strategic move to strengthen economic ties and deepen cooperation in regional supply chains.</p>

        <h3>Technology and Energy Cooperation</h3>
        <p>Energy supply and technology exchange are key areas for cooperation between India and Sri Lanka. India has already been a key partner in providing energy infrastructure support, and there are plans for expanding this collaboration. Furthermore, India’s expertise in digital transformation, particularly in developing Aadhaar-like identity systems and UPI payment interfaces, offers valuable solutions for Sri Lanka’s digital public infrastructure development.</p>

        <h2>Addressing Longstanding Bilateral Issues</h2>
        <h3>Challenges: Fishermen and Maritime Boundaries</h3>
        <p>One of the long-standing challenges between India and Sri Lanka has been the issue of fishermen crossing maritime borders. The dispute has been exacerbated by overfishing in shared waters, leading to tensions between fishermen from both nations. This issue requires careful diplomatic engagement to ensure sustainable fishing practices and to minimize conflicts in the maritime region.</p>

        <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
        <p>To address these challenges, high-level diplomatic engagement is essential. Both countries have explored coordinated fishing models that serve the interests of fishermen while protecting the environment. Such solutions would ensure the sustainability of shared maritime resources and foster goodwill between the two nations.</p>

        <h3>Tamil Minority Rights</h3>
        <p>India has emphasized the need for Sri Lanka to uphold its Constitution and hold provincial council elections, which are vital for ensuring the political representation of Tamil minorities. While India refrained from explicitly mentioning the 13th Amendment—designed to guarantee minority rights—it has underscored the importance of meaningful political participation for all ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. This complex issue requires a delicate balance, as Sinhala nationalists and political compulsions must be carefully considered in the diplomatic discourse.</p>
