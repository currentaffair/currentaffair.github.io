        Impact of Increased Classroom Time on Indian Higher Education
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Indian students in Higher Education (HE) are spending considerably more time in the classroom than their European Union (EU) and North American counterparts. Yet, despite this extra time, there is concern that they remain relatively undereducated. Two primary factors contribute to this disparity: the higher proportion of teaching time in course credits and the increased number of courses per semester under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>A Comparison: Classroom Time and Its Impact</h2>
            <p><strong>EU and North American students:</strong> An average university student in the EU or North America takes approximately four courses a semester, with a maximum of three hours of lectures per course each week. This results in a total of up to 12 hours of classroom time per week.</p>
            <p><strong>Indian students:</strong> In contrast, Indian students in four-year undergraduate programs are required to take five courses per semester, each with four hours of classroom time. This amounts to 20 hours per week in the classroom.</p>
            <p>While this may seem beneficial, the extra eight hours of classroom time do not leave much room for essential academic activities such as self-study, reading, or assignments, which can lead to student exhaustion and reduced learning effectiveness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Assessment Challenges</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>The increase in classroom hours has led to a reduction in the number of assessments that can be feasibly conducted within a course. In the earlier version of the choice-based credit system, there was more scope for continuous assessment. However, with the current structure, students are struggling to complete more than two assessments per course.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This shift impacts the diversity of assessments, with multiple-choice exams often replacing more comprehensive tasks such as term papers or reflective essays. This, in turn, encourages rote learning and undermines the development of critical thinking and deeper learning. To address this, the education system needs to provide students with more opportunities to take ownership of their learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Continuous Assessment under NEP 2020</h3>
            <p>The NEP 2020 emphasizes continuous assessment as a means to foster ongoing learning and development. The idea is to move away from the traditional system of relying on one or two high-stakes exams at the end of a course.</p>
            <p>By introducing a variety of low and high-stakes assessments spread throughout the semester, students can be incentivized to maintain consistent effort and avoid last-minute cramming. This system also provides valuable feedback for both students and faculty, allowing adjustments in teaching and learning strategies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Teaching Load: India vs EU/North America</h3>
            <p>In comparison with the EU and North America, where the average weekly classroom teaching load for a faculty member is about nine hours, Indian faculty are typically expected to teach between 14-16 hours per week. This added teaching load detracts from the time available for research, course revisions, and development of new programs, potentially impacting the quality of education provided.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Teachers' Role and NEP 2020 Vision</h3>
            <p>Under the NEP 2020, teachers are not only responsible for delivering lectures but are also expected to design courses, select reading materials, develop assessments, and grade students. This shift contrasts with the earlier model where teaching and assessment were largely handled by the affiliating university. However, in elite institutions like IITs and IIMs, faculty might have fewer classroom hours but significantly more resources and support.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>To fully realize the vision of the NEP 2020, there needs to be a critical reconsideration of the classroom time and course structure within Indiaâ€™s four-year undergraduate programs. Reducing classroom hours and redistributing time for self-study and reflection will better equip Indian students for independent learning, critical thinking, and global competitiveness. A balanced approach will help students move away from rote learning and prepare them for higher-level academic pursuits, aligning them more closely with their international counterparts.</p>
