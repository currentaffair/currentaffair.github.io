        The Unfinished Task: Manmohan Singh's Reform Legacy
    </header>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Manmohan Singh’s tenure as Finance Minister during the 1991 economic reforms marked a turning point in India’s economic history. His reforms, mainly focused on liberalisation and globalisation, transformed India’s economic structure from a centrally planned system to a market-driven economy. However, despite the success of these reforms, the task of implementing subsequent reforms was left unfinished, which presents challenges for future economic growth.

        <section class="section-block">
            <h2>Key Features of the 1991 Economic Reforms</h2>
            <p>
                The 1991 reforms were a major shift from India’s traditional economic policies. Two primary features of these reforms were liberalisation and globalisation.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Liberalisation</h3>
                <p>
                    The de-licensing of industries and the opening up of sectors to private players were central to liberalisation. The government dismantled price, exchange rate, and import controls, allowing the market to function more efficiently.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Globalisation</h3>
                <p>
                    The reforms removed barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio investments, facilitating technology collaborations and enabling access to both domestic and international capital markets. This paved the way for greater integration into the global economy.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>These reforms included significant measures such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two-step devaluation of the Indian rupee</li>
                <li>Announcement of the New Industrial Policy</li>
                <li>Presentation of the 1991-92 Union Budget</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These reforms marked a shift from central planning, import substitution, and public sector monopolies to a more market-driven, private sector-friendly approach.

            <h2>Missed Opportunities for Reforms 2.0</h2>
            <p>
                Although the initial 1991 reforms were groundbreaking, successive governments, including Singh’s tenure as Prime Minister from 2004-2014, did not implement the second wave of reforms necessary for India’s sustained economic growth.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Privatisation</h3>
                <p>
                    Progress in privatisation was slow, with only a few state-owned enterprises being privatised. For example, companies like Air India and Maruti Udyog saw privatisation, but many others were left untouched.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Rationalising Government Spending</h3>
                <p>
                    Government spending continued to increase, especially in the form of subsidies and transfer schemes. While these schemes aimed at providing short-term welfare, they resulted in several negative consequences. For instance, underpricing fertilizers led to soil nutrient imbalance, declining crop yields, and depletion of aquifers.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                These missed opportunities meant that the long-term potential of India’s economic growth was not fully realised. Instead, resources that could have been invested in infrastructure, education, and healthcare were instead allocated to short-term welfare programs.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section-block">
            <h2>Modi Government’s Groundwork for Reforms</h2>
            <p>
                The current government has laid a foundation for future reforms, with initiatives such as linking welfare schemes to specific recipients and seeding Aadhaar with bank accounts for direct cash transfers to beneficiaries. These measures aim to address inefficiencies in the welfare system and reduce market-distorting subsidies.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section-block">
            <h2>Way Forward</h2>
            <p>
                For India to fully capitalise on its economic potential, it is crucial to relaunch reforms focusing on privatisation, reducing government interference in business, and shifting from welfare subsidies to sustainable investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p>
                Implementing direct cash transfers can further reduce inefficiencies and ensure that welfare schemes reach the intended beneficiaries more effectively.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Manmohan Singh’s economic reforms were transformative, but the unfinished agenda of Reforms 2.0 remains a critical task. The privatisation of state-owned enterprises, rationalising subsidies, and transitioning to sustainable development are essential to ensure India’s long-term economic growth. The government must continue the reform process and address these issues to secure a prosperous future for the country.
