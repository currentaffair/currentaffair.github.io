    <h1>Gender-Sensitive Policy Making in India</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Gender-sensitive policy making recognizes and addresses the specific and often unequal impacts of policies on different genders, particularly in societies where historical and systemic inequalities exist. In India, such policies have gained urgency following incidents like the Anna University sexual assault case, where institutional insensitivity worsened the trauma faced by survivors. The lack of adequate support and justice in such cases reflects broader societal challenges, underlining the critical need for transformative approaches to gender equity.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Why is Gender-Sensitive Policy Making Necessary?</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Persistent Gender Disparities:</strong> Gender inequality remains a significant challenge, reflected in several key areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Female Labor Force Participation:</strong> The Economic Survey 2023-2024 reports an increase in the female Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR) to 37% in 2022-2023, up from 23.3% in 2017-2018, though still lagging behind countries like China at 61.5%.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wage Inequality:</strong> India's gender wage gap remains at 39.8%, meaning women earn only Rs 39.8 for every Rs 100 earned by men, though recent efforts have helped close 64.1% of this gap.</li>
                    <li><strong>Educational Gaps:</strong> Despite India producing the highest percentage of women STEM graduates globally (40%), their representation in STEM jobs is only 14%, showing that educational advancements don’t always translate to equal job opportunities.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Socio-Cultural Barriers:</strong> Deep-rooted patriarchal norms continue to restrict women's mobility and decision-making power. For instance, nearly 47% of Indian women report having a say in household financial decisions, indicating the systemic gender imbalances still prevalent.</p>

            <p><strong>Violence and Safety Concerns:</strong> The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2023 report highlighted a 4% increase in crimes against women in 2022, illustrating the serious safety concerns that many women face daily.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Economic and Developmental Imperatives</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Economic Growth Potential:</strong> Increasing women's participation in the workforce could add $700 billion to India's GDP by 2025, contributing to a 16% increase in economic growth. However, achieving this requires targeted interventions to overcome the barriers limiting women’s full participation.</p>

                <p><strong>Healthcare Outcomes:</strong> Gender-sensitive health policies could improve maternal and child health outcomes, as evidenced by ongoing efforts to reduce India's maternal mortality ratio, which currently stands at 97 per 100,000 live births.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Moral and Legal Dimensions</h2>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Constitutional Mandate:</strong> Articles 14, 15, 16, 39(d), and 42 of the Indian Constitution guarantee equality before the law and prohibit discrimination, making gender-sensitive policy a constitutional requirement.</p>
                <p><strong>Global Commitments:</strong> As a signatory to international conventions like CEDAW, India has a legal obligation to adopt and implement policies that promote gender equality and women’s rights.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Steps Toward Gender-Sensitive Policy Making</h2>
            <p><strong>Legislative Framework:</strong> Key laws such as the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 and the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013 have been instrumental in promoting gender equality in India. Additionally, the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013 has introduced stricter punishments for crimes like sexual assault, marking a strong commitment to combating gender-based violence.</p>

            <p><strong>Government Initiatives:</strong> Initiatives like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and Gender Budgeting (introduced in 2005) are critical to creating gender-sensitive frameworks. In 2024-25, over Rs. 3 lakh crore were allocated to schemes benefiting women, aimed at promoting women-led development.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Way Forward for Gender-Sensitive Policy Making</h2>
            <p><strong>Strengthening Institutional Mechanisms:</strong> It is crucial to expand the Gender Budget Cells across ministries to ensure systematic planning and resource allocation for gender-specific programs. Additionally, regular audits will assess the effectiveness of these programs.</p>

            <p><strong>Data Collection and Analysis:</strong> Implementing real-time tracking systems for gender-disaggregated data will support evidence-based policy-making, enabling better evaluation of the impact of policies on gender equality.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>Gender-sensitive policy making is not merely a governance tool but a socio-economic necessity. While India has made commendable strides through progressive legislations and initiatives, bridging systemic gaps demands continuous efforts. By addressing structural barriers and fostering inclusive frameworks, gender equity can be transformed from an ideal to a reality, ensuring justice, dignity, and sustainable development for all.</p>
