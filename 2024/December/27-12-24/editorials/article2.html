        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan Yojana (PM-SMY) is a Central Sector Pension Scheme aimed at workers in the unorganised sector. Launched in 2019, the scheme targets workers with a monthly income of up to Rs 15,000. It provides a pension of Rs 3,000 per month after the age of 60. However, the scheme has faced several challenges, as highlighted in a recent report by the Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC).</p>

        <h2>Key Features of PM-SYM</h2>
        <p>The scheme is designed to provide financial security to the unorganised workforce. The government and workers share contributions, with amounts ranging from Rs 55 to Rs 200 per month, based on the worker’s age. Upon reaching 60, the worker is entitled to a pension of Rs 3,000 per month. In case of the worker’s death, the spouse is eligible for a 50% family pension.</p>

        <h2>Highlights of the Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) Report</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Poor Performance of PM-SMY</h3>
            <p>The PSC report has raised serious concerns regarding the underperformance of PM-SYM. Despite aiming to enroll 100 million workers by 2023, only 5 million workers had enrolled by FY 2024. Government contributions have significantly decreased, from Rs 324.23 crore in FY 2021-22 to Rs 162.51 crore in FY 2023-24.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Reasons for Underperformance</h3>
            <p>The primary reasons for poor enrollment include irregular income, financial instability, lack of awareness, and competing pension schemes. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges, making it even harder for workers to participate.</p>

        <h2>Recommendations for Revamping PM-SYM</h2>
        <div class="recommendation">
            <h3>Proposed Changes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase the eligibility age from 40 to 50 to include older workers.</li>
                <li>Merge PM-SYM with other pension schemes for better reach and impact.</li>
                <li>Integrate PM-SYM with the e-Shram portal, which has a database of over 305 million workers, to streamline enrollment.</li>
                <li>Introduce Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) to assist workers who cannot afford to contribute.</li>
                <li>Launch comprehensive awareness campaigns to improve understanding of the scheme.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Who Are Unorganised Workers?</h2>
        <p>Unorganised workers, as defined by the Unorganised Workers' Social Security Act, 2008, include home-based workers, self-employed individuals, and wage workers who are not covered under key labor laws. They make up a significant portion of India’s workforce and are often deprived of social security benefits and formal employment protections.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The PM-SYM has the potential to offer significant benefits to unorganised workers, but its current challenges must be addressed. A revamped scheme with increased awareness, expanded eligibility, and better integration with existing infrastructure can help achieve its intended objectives. By making these adjustments, the government can ensure a more inclusive social security system for the unorganised sector.</p>
