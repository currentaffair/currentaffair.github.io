        <h2>Why in News?</h2>
        <p>26th December 2024, marked the 20th anniversary of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What was the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami?</h2>
        <p>The earthquake had a magnitude of 9.1, making it the third-largest earthquake in recorded history. It originated in the Sunda Trench, where the Indo-Australian plate subducts beneath the Burma microplate.</p>
        <p>The tremors affected an area of 1,300 km, spanning across Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, and several other countries. In India, the Car Nicobar Indian Air Force base was completely destroyed, highlighting the scale of destruction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Impact and Displacement</h2>
        <p>The tsunami resulted in over 227,000 deaths, marking it as the deadliest tsunami in recorded history. More than 1.7 million people were displaced due to massive destruction.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>India did not anticipate such a large event along its eastern coast. This tsunami acted as a wake-up call for the country's disaster preparedness.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Tsunami Basics</h2>
        <p>Tsunamis are giant waves triggered by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or other disruptions. While the waves travel quickly across the deep ocean, they slow down and grow taller as they approach the coast.</p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>India's 7,516 km coastline has nearly 5,700 km vulnerable to tsunamis and cyclones, necessitating significant mitigation strategies.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Post-Tsunami Initiatives</h2>
        <p>Following the 2004 disaster, India established the Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre (ITEWC) in 2007. This centre uses seismic stations, bottom pressure recorders, and tidal stations to detect potential tsunami threats.</p>
        <p>The ITEWC is a critical part of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning & Mitigation System, which has expanded globally, incorporating 150 stations worldwide for real-time monitoring.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Technological Advancements</h2>
        <p>With advancements in technology, tsunami early warning systems are now faster and more accurate, utilizing supercomputers and better algorithms for prediction.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>India's advancements in tsunami monitoring make it the 5th country globally to implement such a system, alongside the US, Japan, Chile, and Australia.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>What are NDMA Guidelines for Tsunami Mitigation?</h2>
        <p>The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) provides guidelines to reduce the risk of tsunami disasters. These include risk mapping, early warning systems, coastal zoning, and community preparedness.</p>
        <p>Key initiatives include building tsunami-resilient infrastructure, conducting regular public awareness campaigns, and ensuring a coordinated response across national and local agencies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami exposed the critical need for effective early warning systems. Significant progress has been made, with advancements in technology, international cooperation, and disaster preparedness. However, challenges persist, particularly in developing regions that remain vulnerable to similar natural disasters.</p>
