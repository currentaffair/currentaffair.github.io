        <h1>India’s Green Hydrogen Ambition</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>India has ambitious goals in the field of green hydrogen, aiming to produce 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) annually by 2030. Green hydrogen, produced through renewable energy sources like solar and wind, has the potential to transform the country’s energy landscape by reducing its dependency on fossil fuels and cutting down carbon emissions. However, despite the significant potential, India faces numerous challenges in realizing this vision, primarily due to high costs, financing challenges, and technological hurdles.</p>

        <h2>Challenges in Achieving India’s Green Hydrogen Goal</h2>
        <h3>1. High Production Costs</h3>
        <p>The production cost of green hydrogen is one of the most significant barriers India faces in meeting its ambitious targets. The cost of producing green hydrogen ranges from $5.30 to $6.70 per kilogram, whereas grey hydrogen costs only $1.90 to $2.40 per kilogram.</p>

        <h3>2. Financing Green Hydrogen Projects</h3>
        <p>Green hydrogen projects require large upfront investments, and the financing model in India adds to the complexity. Higher borrowing costs increase the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which raises hydrogen production costs.</p>

        <h3>3. Electrolyzer and Equipment Costs</h3>
        <p>Electrolyzers are essential for producing green hydrogen. The cost of electrolyzers varies between $500 to $1,800 per kilowatt, depending on the type used, which adds to the production costs.</p>

        <h2>Current Progress and Global Perspective</h2>
        <p>India’s progress is slow, with only 10% of the target being met as of now. Globally, investments in clean hydrogen projects have also been slow, with only 27.6% of large-scale projects reaching final investment decisions by May 2024.</p>

        <h2>Policy Approaches and Global Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Countries like the UK, US, Japan, and Australia have implemented various policies and financing mechanisms to boost green hydrogen production, such as low-carbon hydrogen certification, hydrogen hubs, and de-risking strategies.</p>

        <h2>India’s Strategic Focus for Green Hydrogen</h2>
        <p>India is focusing on early projects in Odisha, Maharashtra, and Gujarat to establish green hydrogen hubs and improve financial structuring for long-term sustainability.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>India’s green hydrogen ambition is a challenging yet promising journey that requires extensive collaboration, innovative financing, and policy reforms to ensure that the country meets its target of 5 MMT by 2030.</p>
