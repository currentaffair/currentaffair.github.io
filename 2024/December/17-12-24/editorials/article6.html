<header>GST Hike Proposal on Tobacco and Sugar-Sweetened Beverages</header>

<div class="container">

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India has remained relatively unchanged for harmful products like tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages since its introduction seven years ago. Despite two minor hikes in National Calamity Contingent Duties (NCCD) on tobacco, the affordability of these products has increased, undermining public health efforts to reduce their consumption. This article explores the recent proposal to increase the GST on tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages, a move aimed at addressing public health challenges and fiscal concerns.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h3>Impact of the Proposed GST Hike</h3>
        <p>
            India, as the second-largest tobacco consumer in the world, faces significant public health risks. Approximately 28.6% of adults and 8.5% of students aged 13 to 15 use tobacco products. Tobacco use is a leading cause of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), resulting in more than 3,500 deaths per day. The economic burden of tobacco-related diseases was estimated at ₹2,340 billion in 2017, which is 1.4% of India's GDP—significantly higher than the annual tobacco tax revenue of ₹538 billion.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
            The proposed GST hike to 35% is expected to reduce tobacco consumption by 5% while increasing tax revenues by 18.6%. This would generate an additional ₹43 billion annually from beedis, cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h3>Limitations and Considerations of the Proposed Hike</h3>
        <p>
            Although the recommendation to increase the GST rate to 35% is a positive step, a higher rate of 40% could have a more substantial impact. The 40% GST rate would lead to sharper price increases, larger reductions in consumption, and an additional ₹72 billion in revenue. Additionally, the tax burden on tobacco products is currently uneven, with beedis being taxed at only 22% of the retail price, compared to cigarettes and smokeless tobacco at 49.5% and 64%, respectively. A higher GST rate would help reduce this discrepancy, contributing to a more equitable taxation system.
        </p>

    <section class="section">
        <h3>Concerns about Illicit Trade</h3>
        <p>
            The tobacco industry has raised concerns that higher taxes would increase illicit trade. However, evidence from India and other countries suggests that tax hikes have minimal impact on illicit trade. Key factors influencing illicit markets include the quality of tax administration, government commitment, and social acceptance of taxation. Therefore, while concerns about illicit trade should be addressed, they should not deter the implementation of higher taxes on harmful products.

        <h3>Balancing GST and Excise Taxes</h3>
        <p>
            One of the key issues with the current GST framework is its reliance on ad valorem taxes, which are tied to the product price. This type of taxation is less effective than specific excise taxes in curbing tobacco consumption, as the industry can manipulate prices. Since the introduction of GST, the share of excise taxes in total tobacco taxation has decreased, reducing its effectiveness. To strengthen the tax framework, the government should consider increasing excise taxes alongside the GST hike.
        </p>

    <section class="section">
        <h3>GST Hike on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages</h3>
        <p>
            Alongside the tobacco tax hike, the proposal also includes raising GST on sugar-sweetened beverages, which are major contributors to obesity, diabetes, and other NCDs. Increasing the GST rate to 35% could discourage consumption and align with India's broader public health goals. However, the government could consider adding health-focused levies, such as a specific excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, to enhance the effectiveness of the tax structure.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h3>Way Forward: Key Considerations for the GST Council</h3>
        <p>
            As the GST Council reviews the recommendations, it is crucial to consider raising GST rates to 40% for both tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages. Pairing this with higher excise taxes would create a mixed tax structure, which has been shown to be more effective at reducing consumption. Such reforms would not only align with global best practices but also support India's public health goals and generate vital revenue for development.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The proposed GST hike on tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages represents a critical step in addressing the dual challenges of public health and fiscal sustainability in India. By reducing the tax burden discrepancies among different tobacco products and considering a more comprehensive tax structure, the government can significantly reduce the health and economic impacts of these harmful products. This would also help in generating additional revenue for public welfare and development.
