        <h1>Supreme Court Ruling on NIA's Jurisdiction and Coconut Oil Taxation</h1>

        <h2>1. NIA's Expanded Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court expanded the National Investigation Agency (NIA)'s jurisdiction to allow the investigation of non-scheduled offences connected to scheduled offences under the NIA Act.</p>
        <p>The court clarified that Section 8 allows the NIA to investigate connected offences even outside its usual scope, ensuring comprehensive investigation of criminal networks.</p>

        <h2>2. About the NIA</h2>
        <p>The NIA was established in 2008 after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks to combat terrorism-related crimes. It reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs and can investigate terrorism cases across India.</p>
        <p>The NIA's process involves the Central Government determining the need for investigation, with the agency also having the authority to investigate cases on its own initiative.</p>

        <h2>3. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme</h2>
        <p>The government is considering ending the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) scheme due to high financing costs. The SGBs were launched in 2015 to provide an alternative to physical gold investments, offering a fixed interest rate and the option to be traded in the secondary market.</p>
        <p>The SGBs have been profitable, with returns of over 120% on initial investments, but their continued issuance is under review due to declining demand and changes in gold duties.</p>

        <h2>4. Supreme Court's Ruling on Coconut Oil Taxation</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court ruled that coconut oil should be classified as an edible oil under India's GST regime and taxed at 5%, rather than the higher 18% rate for hair care products.</p>
        <p>The court's decision clarified that the classification of coconut oil should be based on its intended use as an edible oil, not the container size, as per the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN).</p>
