        <h1>Abathsahayeshwarar Temple & Coconut Oil Classification</h1>

        <h2>Context: Abathsahayeshwarar Temple</h2>
        <p>The 1,300-year-old Abathsahayeshwarar Temple in Thukkatchi, Tamil Nadu, has received the UNESCO Award of Distinction for cultural heritage conservation in 2023. The temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, was built by the Cholas and further expanded by the Nayaks in the 16th century.</p>

        <h2>Temple Features</h2>
        <p>The temple is an important religious site, with shrines for various deities, including Soundaryanayaki Ambal and Ashtabhuja Durga. It is also significant in the Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram.</p>

        <h2>Architectural Details</h2>
        <p>The temple features a five-tier gopuram (gateway tower), surrounded by two prakarams (precincts). It represents a fine example of Chola and Nayak architecture.</p>

        <h2>Context: Coconut Oil Classification</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that coconut oil should be classified as an edible oil under India's GST regime and taxed at 5%, rejecting the earlier classification as hair oil, which attracted an 18% tax.</p>

        <h2>Legal Battle and Supreme Court Ruling</h2>
        <p>The legal challenge began in 2007, with authorities disputing the classification of coconut oil. The Supreme Court ruled that the size of the packaging should not determine classification. The law defines coconut oil as an edible oil, and international standards like the Harmonized System of Nomenclature were applied to determine its classification.</p>

        <h2>Importance of the Ruling</h2>
        <p>This decision clarifies that coconut oil is an edible product, despite being packaged in small containers. The ruling aligns with international norms and ensures a uniform classification under GST.</p>
