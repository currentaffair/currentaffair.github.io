        <h1>Cyclone Chido & Coconut Oil Classification</h1>

        <h2>About Cyclone Chido</h2>
        <p>Prime Minister recently addressed the devastation caused by Cyclone Chido in the French overseas island territory of Mayotte near Madagascar. It was a severe tropical cyclone that hit Mayotte in December 2024, with sustained winds exceeding 200 km/h, making it the strongest storm in 90 years.</p>

        <h2>About Mayotte</h2>
        <p>Mayotte is located in the northern Mozambique Channel between Madagascar and Mozambique. Known for its biodiversity, it includes Grande-Terre and Petite-Terre islands along with several islets. The territory also has one of the largest enclosed lagoons in the world.</p>

        <h2>What is a Cyclone?</h2>
        <p>Cyclones are caused by atmospheric disturbances and characterized by rapid, destructive air circulation. Cyclones can be classified as extratropical or tropical. Tropical cyclones develop in tropical waters and are driven by heat from the sea, while extratropical cyclones occur in temperate regions.</p>

        <h2>Global Terminology</h2>
        <p>Cyclones have different names in various regions: typhoons in the China Sea, hurricanes in the Caribbean, and willy-willies in Australia, among others. The Indian Meteorological Department classifies cyclones based on wind strength, storm waves, and precipitation.</p>

        <h2>Supreme Court Ruling on Coconut Oil Classification</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court ruled that coconut oil should be classified as an edible oil under India's GST regime, taxed at 5% rather than the 18% applied to hair care products. The ruling resolved a long-standing legal battle over coconut oil's classification.</p>

        <h2>Legal Battle and Supreme Court Ruling</h2>
        <p>The legal struggle began in 2007 when the Customs and Excise Board attempted to classify coconut oil as a hair product, which would have been taxed at a higher rate. The Supreme Court clarified in 2024 that coconut oil is an edible oil, following international standards like the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and that packaging size doesn't determine its classification.</p>
