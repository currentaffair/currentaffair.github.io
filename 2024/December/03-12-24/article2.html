        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="section">
            The 2024 *Lancet Countdown on Climate Change and Health* emphasizes the urgent need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. It calls for **health-centric approaches** to climate finance, particularly for interventions aimed at reducing exposure to air pollution through transitions to clean energy sources. These shifts are critical for mitigating the dual challenges of climate change and public health crises.
        </div>

        <h1>Ambient and Household Air Pollution (HAP)</h1>
        <h2>Ambient Air Pollution (AAP)</h2>
        <div class="section">
            AAP in urban areas, especially in regions like NCR, becomes glaringly visible during winter, with its roots in **industrial emissions**, **vehicular exhaust**, and **crop residue burning**. Despite the efforts of the **National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)** to improve urban air quality, rural contributors remain largely overlooked.
        </div>

        <h2>Household Air Pollution (HAP)</h2>
        <div class="section">
            In rural India, HAP arises from the use of **solid fuels (biomass)** in inefficient cooking practices. Key pollutants such as PM2.5, carbon monoxide, and black carbon significantly harm public health. This reliance on biomass underpins a cycle of health and environmental degradation.
        </div>

        <h1>Challenges in Transitioning to Clean Energy</h1>
        <h2>Energy Equity</h2>
        <div class="section">
            Poor populations rely heavily on biomass due to economic constraints. Transitioning to **cleaner fuels like LPG** often seems contrary to global decarbonization goals but holds immense potential for health benefits and reduced emissions.
        </div>

        <h2>Misplaced Climate Priorities</h2>
        <div class="section">
            While biomass combustion exacerbates climate change, **LPG offers a balanced solution** by minimizing harmful emissions, thereby reconciling climate and health priorities.
        </div>

        <h1>Opportunities Ahead</h1>
        <h2>Strengthening Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)</h2>
        <div class="section">
            Programs like PMUY need to be bolstered with **increased subsidies** for the most vulnerable, **awareness campaigns** about health benefits, and investment in infrastructure to ensure accessibility and affordability.
        </div>

        <h2>Health-Centric Climate Finance</h2>
        <div class="section">
            International climate finance must prioritize clean energy transitions in the residential sector, especially LPG adoption, to achieve both health and environmental objectives.
        </div>

        <h1>Health Benefits</h1>
        <div class="section">
            The shift to LPG dramatically reduces health expenditure by mitigating illnesses caused by HAP and AAP. It also fosters improved **child growth**, and reduced **morbidity and mortality rates** in adults. Immediate reductions in emissions from biomass combustion offer visible health gains.
        </div>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <div class="conclusion">
            Failing to promote transitions from biomass cooking fuels to LPG risks leaving vulnerable communities in energy and health inequities. Strengthening initiatives like PMUY and aligning NCAP priorities with clean energy transitions can deliver transformative outcomes for public health and environmental sustainability.
