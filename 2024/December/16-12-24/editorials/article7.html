        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Technology has become the cornerstone of global leadership, overtaking traditional measures of power such as GDP. Frontier technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, quantum computing, genetic engineering, clean-tech, and space exploration now play a crucial role in determining global dominance. In this fast-evolving landscape, countries that harness these technologies effectively will lead the 21st century.</p>

        <h2>The Shift from GDP to Technology</h2>
        <h3>Redefining Global Dominance</h3>
        <p>While GDP figures, whether in real terms or adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), were once the primary indicators of global influence, this is no longer the case. Today, technological prowess is a more accurate measure of a nation's global standing. For instance, while the U.S. leads China by $10 trillion in real GDP, China surpasses the U.S. by $4 trillion when adjusted for PPP.</p>

        <h3>Technology’s Central Role</h3>
        <p>In the current world order, technological leadership is paramount. The 21st century will be shaped by five or six key technologies that will determine the trajectory of global power.</p>

        <h2>Recent Breakthroughs in Frontier Technologies</h2>
        <h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
        <p class="highlight">One of the most transformative fields is quantum computing. Google's Willow chip, for example, is capable of solving problems in less than five minutes that would take conventional supercomputers 10 septillion years to solve.</p>
        
        <h2>India's Technological Journey</h2>
        <h3>Supercomputing Milestones</h3>
        <p>India has made significant strides in supercomputing, starting with its first supercomputer, Param 8000, developed in 1991 under the leadership of Vijay Bhatkar. More recent advancements include Param Shivay and AIRAWAT, which ranked 75th globally. However, India faces challenges in quantum technologies, where it lags behind global leaders.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: India’s Technological Leap</h2>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>India has the talent and leadership capacity to become a leader in the frontier tech race. With visionary leadership, strategic investments, and greater collaboration between the public and private sectors, India can position itself as a global technology powerhouse.</p>
