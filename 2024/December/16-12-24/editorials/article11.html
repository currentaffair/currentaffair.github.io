        Supreme Court’s Renewed Emphasis on Monitoring Manipur
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The ongoing ethnic violence in Manipur has drawn the attention of the Supreme Court of India, which has stepped in to ensure that the state government takes necessary actions to address the situation. This intervention focuses on the disclosure of information regarding destroyed properties and encroachments, highlighting the failure of local authorities in managing the violence. The Court’s involvement reflects a broader issue of government inaction, prompting the establishment of a committee led by Justice Gita Mittal to oversee investigations and humanitarian relief efforts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Supreme Court’s Role in Monitoring the Violence</h2>
            <p>The case centers on the petitioners who have expressed concerns over the persistent violence that has been gripping Manipur for over a year. The Court’s directive to the Manipur government to disclose details regarding the extent of destruction and encroachments marks a critical point in the judicial oversight of the situation. This marks a shift from the typical responsibilities of the state and union governments, necessitated by the severity of the crisis.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">The Justice Gita Mittal-led Committee</h2>
            <p>The Justice Gita Mittal-led Committee, formed to monitor the violence, has been extended in its tenure to continue overseeing both investigations and relief efforts. Despite its critical role, the committee’s operations are sometimes shrouded in secrecy, particularly regarding sensitive information about the violence. This secrecy has raised concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of the interventions, particularly when the government argues that national security concerns justify withholding information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Judiciary’s Role vs. Government Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Ideally, the task of restoring peace and order in Manipur should fall under the purview of the state and union governments. However, the government's reluctance to address the growing unrest, compounded by internal political divisions and lack of accountability, has forced the judiciary to intervene. The increasing ethnic tensions have resulted in the destruction of property, sexual violence, and the rise of armed non-state actors, necessitating judicial oversight for meaningful progress.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">The Rise of Non-State Actors and Armed Violence</h2>
            <p>In Manipur, armed groups, some of which have looted state weapons, are becoming increasingly influential. These non-state actors have escalated the violence, targeting areas previously untouched by ethnic strife, such as Jiribam. Their presence is contributing to a destabilizing influence on the state’s political process, further complicating efforts to restore peace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">National Attention and Government Secrecy</h2>
            <p>Manipur's ethnic violence has drawn significant national attention, particularly after the violence reached unprecedented levels. Despite the government's claims of addressing the situation, a return to the pre-May 2023 status quo remains elusive. The government’s attempt to conceal critical information under the guise of national security is a significant concern. The Court must continue to prioritize transparency to ensure the resolution of the conflict remains in the public eye.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Global Conflict Resolution Mechanisms</h2>
            <p>Looking beyond national borders, conflict resolution mechanisms such as "truth and reconciliation" processes have become crucial in addressing long-standing ethnic tensions. These global practices prioritize accountability and the restoration of trust, elements that remain largely absent in Manipur’s context. The committee’s findings could provide the necessary momentum for incorporating such mechanisms into the ongoing resolution efforts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The Supreme Court’s continued involvement in Manipur’s ethnic violence underscores the urgent need for effective government intervention. While the judiciary's role in overseeing investigations and relief efforts is commendable, it is clear that the failure of the state and union governments to take decisive action has left the Court with no choice but to assume this supervisory role. To foster lasting peace and reconciliation, transparency, accountability, and the adoption of global conflict resolution practices will be key to addressing the region’s deep-rooted ethnic divides.</p>
