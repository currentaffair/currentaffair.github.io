<header>Supreme Court’s Role in Addressing Manipur's Ethnic Violence</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The ongoing ethnic violence in Manipur has compelled the Supreme Court of India to step in, directing the state government to disclose details of destroyed and encroached properties. This intervention comes amid government inaction and escalating violence. The Court’s oversight is seen as necessary to restore peace and ensure transparency amidst ongoing hostilities and political divisions.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Hearing a Case on Ethnic Violence in Manipur</h2>
    <p>Petitioners aggrieved by the unrelenting hostilities in Manipur have moved the Supreme Court, which has directed the Manipur government to provide details on the extent of the destruction caused by the ethnic violence that began a year and a half ago. This move underscores the severity of the crisis and the Court's necessity in stepping beyond its usual judicial boundaries.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Role of Justice Gita Mittal-led Committee</h2>
    <p>The Court recently extended the tenure of the Justice Gita Mittal-led Committee, which has been overseeing the investigation into the violence and managing humanitarian relief efforts. The Committee's role is critical in ensuring accountability and transparency during this period of turmoil.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Judicial Intervention vs. Government’s Responsibility</h2>
    <p>While the state and union governments are ideally responsible for managing such crises, the failure of political leadership in Manipur has led to judicial intervention. The violent nature of the conflict, including incidents of sexual violence and widespread destruction, prompted the Court to assume a supervisory role through the Mittal Committee. This shift highlights the inefficacy of the state and union governments in addressing the root causes of ethnic tensions and their inability to enforce accountability.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Rise of Non-State Actors and Armed Violence</h2>
    <p>One of the most concerning developments in the conflict is the rise of non-state armed actors. These groups, often equipped with sophisticated weapons looted from state armories, have escalated violence and exerted influence over the political process. Their presence has further destabilized the region, extending the violence to previously unaffected areas.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>National Attention on Manipur’s Ethnic Violence</h2>
    <p>The scale of violence in Manipur only garnered national attention once the situation reached horrifying levels. Despite assurances from the government, a return to the status quo before May 2023 seems increasingly unlikely, making the role of the judiciary even more significant in facilitating long-term solutions.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Court’s Role and Government’s Secrecy</h2>
    <p>While the Court’s renewed attention to Manipur is necessary, the government's attempt to retain secrecy around the committee’s work using "national security" rhetoric has raised concerns. Such attempts at obfuscation may hinder transparency and accountability, which are essential for resolving the conflict. The Court must maintain its role in ensuring the public has access to the necessary information for accountability.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Global Conflict Resolution Mechanisms</h2>
    <p>International conflict resolution practices often emphasize accountability through mechanisms like "truth and reconciliation" commissions. Unfortunately, such mechanisms have been largely absent in Manipur's response to violence. The findings of the Justice Mittal Committee could provide the momentum needed to implement such practices and pave the way for lasting peace.</p>
</section>

<section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Supreme Court’s intervention in Manipur’s ethnic violence highlights the urgency of addressing the escalating conflict. While the responsibility ideally lies with the state and union governments, the Court's involvement demonstrates the failure of political leadership in resolving the crisis. The Justice Mittal-led Committee remains vital in ensuring accountability and fostering reconciliation. To achieve lasting peace, there must be transparency, accountability, and sustained political will.</p>
