    <div class="header">Changing Trends in Fertilizer Use</div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>India’s fertilizer usage has seen significant shifts, primarily due to global and local factors influencing demand and preferences. Recently, the sales of Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP), a key fertilizer for rabi crops, dropped by 25.4% during April to October FY25. Meanwhile, sales of NPKS (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Sulfur) fertilizers surged by 23.5% in the same period. This trend reflects changing preferences driven by higher costs and supply chain disruptions, influencing farmers to opt for more balanced alternatives.</p>

        <h2>Factors Influencing the Shift in Fertilizer Usage</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Global Disruptions</h3>
            <p>Factors like the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war and Belarus sanctions have disrupted global potash markets, leading to price hikes in fertilizers. For instance, the price of Muriate of Potash (MOP) increased in FY23, affecting the cost of key fertilizers such as DAP. Additionally, shipping delays due to geopolitical tensions extended transit times, making DAP even more expensive.</p>
            <p class="highlight">As a result, DAP prices rose to approximately USD 632 per tonne in September 2024, prompting a shift to more cost-effective alternatives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Shift to NPKS Fertilizers</h3>
            <p>NPKS fertilizers are becoming increasingly popular among farmers due to their balanced nutrient composition. The 20:20:0:13 NPKS grade has seen significant growth in sales, as it provides a well-rounded mix of essential nutrients. The improved fertilizer use in Indian soils has raised the NPK ratio to 9.8:3.7:1 in Kharif 2024 from 10.9:4.9:1 in 2023, though it remains below the ideal 4:2:1 ratio.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Benefits of NPKS Fertilizers</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Balanced Nutrient Supply</h3>
            <p>NPKS fertilizers offer a comprehensive supply of essential nutrients—Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), and Sulfur (S). These nutrients are crucial for various growth stages, enhancing crop yield and improving the overall health of plants. This balanced supply ensures better crop productivity and resilience, crucial for meeting India's food security needs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Improved Soil Health and Sustainability</h3>
            <p>Sulfur, an often deficient nutrient in Indian soils, plays a key role in root development and enzyme activation. By incorporating sulfur, NPKS fertilizers improve soil fertility and promote more efficient nutrient uptake by crops, fostering sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Enhanced Crop Yield</h3>
            <p>In addition to improving soil health, NPKS fertilizers boost photosynthesis, strengthen plant immunity, and promote better flowering and fruiting. These benefits translate into higher crop yields, helping meet the growing demand for food production in India.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Challenges with Fertilizer Usage in India</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Imbalance in Fertilizer Use</h3>
            <p>India’s NPK ratio (9.8:3.7:1 in Kharif 2024) deviates significantly from the ideal 4:2:1 ratio, resulting in nutrient imbalances and soil degradation. The excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers, particularly urea, exacerbates the issue, leading to inefficient nutrient distribution and reduced soil quality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Dependence on Imports</h3>
            <p>India relies heavily on imports for key fertilizers—20% of its urea, 50-60% of DAP, and all MOP fertilizers come from abroad. This makes India vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions and price fluctuations, which could affect agricultural sustainability.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Government Initiatives</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Schemes</h3>
            <p>The government has introduced several initiatives to improve fertilizer usage and distribution in India, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PM PRANAM Scheme</li>
                <li>One Nation One Fertilizer (ONOF)</li>
                <li>Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)</li>
                <li>Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS)</li>
                <li>Neem Coated Urea (NCU)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Way Forward</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Promoting Balanced Fertilizer Usage</h3>
            <p>To address the current fertilizer imbalance, the government and farmers must focus on promoting balanced fertilizer use, emphasizing NPKS fertilizers and reducing overreliance on nitrogenous fertilizers like urea. This will improve soil health, boost crop yields, and help create a more sustainable agricultural system in India.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Encouraging Organic and Bio-Fertilizers</h3>
            <p>Incentivizing the use of organic and bio-fertilizers can significantly reduce dependency on chemical fertilizers. These alternatives help maintain soil health, increase biodiversity, and reduce the environmental footprint of agriculture.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The trends in fertilizer use in India reflect a significant shift towards more sustainable and cost-effective solutions. The growing preference for NPKS fertilizers, driven by supply chain disruptions and high costs of DAP, highlights the importance of balanced nutrient use for improving soil health and crop productivity. Moving forward, it is crucial for policymakers to focus on fostering a sustainable agricultural environment by promoting balanced fertilizer use, encouraging organic farming, and reducing import dependence.</p>
