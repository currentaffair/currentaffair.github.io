    Rising Burden of Non-Communicable Diseases in Urban Populations
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="section">
      The growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in urban areas has become a pressing health challenge in India. NCDs such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are increasingly affecting vulnerable urban populations, exacerbated by rapid urbanization, migration, and socio-economic disparities. This article examines the key drivers, challenges, and policy measures required to address this issue effectively.
    </div>

    <h2>Urbanization and Its Health Implications</h2>
    <div class="section">
      Urbanization has led to significant population shifts, with the urban population projected to reach <span class="highlight">70% by 2050</span>. Interstate migration is also a contributing factor, with over 41 million people moving between states annually. 
      However, nearly 49% of urban residents live in slums, facing triple health burdens:
      <ul>
        <li>Hazardous working conditions.</li>
        <li>Limited access to quality healthcare.</li>
        <li>Financial vulnerability due to catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures.</li>
      </ul>
      These challenges are compounded by the rise of NCDs, despite declining tobacco and alcohol use in urban populations.
    </div>

    <h2>Vulnerable Urban Populations</h2>
    <div class="section">
      Marginalized urban workers such as gig workers, cab drivers, sanitation workers, and bus drivers are at heightened risk. These individuals often lack formal employment contracts and health insurance, leaving them unprotected from the financial and health impacts of NCDs. 
      The <span class="highlight">recent death of a BMTC bus driver due to cardiac arrest</span> highlights the urgent need for better health policies targeting urban workers.
    </div>

    <h2>Policy Implementation and Challenges</h2>
    <div class="section">
      Despite the existence of the national NCD surveillance policy, its poor implementation has hindered progress. Urban health systems are fragmented and overburdened due to rapid urbanization. Key challenges include:
      <ul>
        <li>Balancing surveillance with individual privacy.</li>
        <li>Lack of funding and resources for primary healthcare centers in urban slums.</li>
        <li>Inadequate integration of urban health initiatives with broader public health programs.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Role of Technology and Community Engagement</h2>
    <div class="section">
      Technology offers innovative solutions for managing urban NCDs:
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time monitoring systems for hypertension and diabetes.</li>
        <li>Community-based health promotion and education campaigns to raise awareness.</li>
      </ul>
      Collaborative efforts between local authorities, health departments, and community organizations are essential to ensure equitable access to healthcare.
    </div>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <div class="section">
      To address the rising burden of NCDs, the following measures are recommended:
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a risk-based approach to NCD screening, with a focus on early detection.</li>
        <li>Increase funding for urban primary healthcare, particularly in marginalized communities.</li>
        <li>Foster collaboration between city administrations, local bodies, and community organizations.</li>
        <li>Implement community-led NCD surveillance systems for better data collection and decision-making.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="conclusion">
      Addressing the burden of NCDs in urban populations requires a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes community involvement, technology integration, and robust policy implementation. By co-creating solutions with marginalized groups and focusing on preventive healthcare, India can build healthier and more inclusive cities for all.
