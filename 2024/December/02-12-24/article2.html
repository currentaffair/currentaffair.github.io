    <div class="title">Impact of School Closures Due to Air Pollution in Delhi</div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The decision to shift schools in Delhi to online mode in November 2024 under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) has sparked widespread criticism. While the initiative aims to address severe air pollution, the closure of schools raises significant concerns regarding scientific validity, socio-economic effects, and practicality.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Understanding Delhi’s Air Quality Crisis</h2>
        <h3>Health Risks Beyond AQI 400</h3>
        <p>
            Air pollution affects human health when the Air Quality Index (AQI) exceeds <span class="highlight">50 (‘good’ air quality)</span> under Indian norms. However, thresholds like GRAP's focus on AQI levels beyond 400 fail to address the persistent harm from levels between 51 and 399, which also compromise health.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Delhi’s Alarming Air Quality Trends</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2024:</strong> Not a single day recorded with ‘good’ air quality.</li>
                <li><strong>2023:</strong> Only one day was marked as ‘good’ for air quality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These figures highlight prolonged exposure to harmful air for both children and adults, underscoring the need for structural and sustainable interventions rather than temporary solutions like school closures.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Impacts of School Closures</h2>
        <h3>Learning and Development Challenges</h3>
        <p>
            The abrupt shift to online learning has several drawbacks:
            <ul>
                <li>Screen-based learning struggles to replicate in-person interactions, especially for younger children.</li>
                <li>Prolonged isolation disrupts critical social and emotional development.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Nutritional Inequity</h3>
        <p>
            For many underprivileged children, mid-day meals in schools represent their primary source of nutrition. Denial of this support deepens malnutrition and worsens socio-economic inequalities.
        </p>

        <h3>Digital Divide</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Marginalized communities</span> lack reliable access to digital infrastructure, making online education inaccessible to many. This disparity is especially stark in urban-rural settings, where infrastructure gaps exacerbate inequities in learning.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Science-Based Alternatives to School Closures</h2>
        <h3>Keeping Schools Functional</h3>
        <p>
            Policies should focus on adapting school operations rather than shutting them entirely:
            <ul>
                <li>Temporarily suspend outdoor activities instead of closing schools.</li>
                <li>Install air purifiers and improve classroom ventilation to ensure safer indoor environments.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Customized Approaches</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of blanket measures, tailored solutions should be adopted:
            <ul>
                <li>Provide hybrid learning options to accommodate health concerns.</li>
                <li>Introduce flexible attendance policies for at-risk children.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Learning from International Practices</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beijing, China:</strong> Schools modify activities based on real-time air quality alerts.</li>
                <li><strong>South Korea:</strong> High-efficiency air purifiers are mandated in classrooms, with government subsidies for maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>Germany:</strong> Schools prioritize vegetation barriers to filter air pollutants.</li>
                <li><strong>California, USA:</strong> Parents can opt for their children to stay home on poor AQI days, while schools remain operational for others.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            As Nelson Mandela observed, “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.” Addressing environmental challenges while safeguarding the holistic well-being of children must remain the cornerstone of any policy framework. A balanced, science-driven approach is essential for ensuring both educational continuity and public health.
