        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The decision to shift schools to online mode in Delhi during November 2024, under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), has sparked widespread debate. While aimed at mitigating the effects of severe air pollution, the closure of schools highlights deeper challenges. These include questions about the scientific rationale, socio-economic impacts, and the long-term consequences on children's education and development.</p>

        <!-- Understanding the Problem -->
        <h2>Understanding Delhi’s Air Pollution Crisis</h2>
        <h3>Health Impacts Beyond AQI 400</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) measures air pollution levels, with values above 50 already posing health risks under Indian standards. However, the GRAP framework primarily focuses on AQI levels exceeding 400, neglecting the cumulative damage caused by moderately high pollution levels (AQI 51-399). For instance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">2024:</span> Delhi reported no "good" air quality days so far.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">2023:</span> Only one "good" air quality day was recorded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This prolonged exposure to harmful air emphasizes the urgent need for long-term structural solutions rather than temporary measures like school closures.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Impacts of School Closures -->
        <h2>Impacts of School Closures</h2>
        <h3>Learning and Development</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Shifting to online education disrupts classroom interaction and critical thinking, especially for children under 12. Prolonged screen exposure can hinder cognitive and emotional development. Studies from the COVID-19 pandemic highlight significant delays in learning and socialization among children.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Nutritional Challenges</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>For many underprivileged students, mid-day meals provided in schools serve as their primary source of nutrition. School closures deprive them of this essential support, worsening malnutrition and exacerbating inequality.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Equity Concerns</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>The digital divide disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Families lacking stable internet or digital devices face further isolation, widening the educational gap between urban and rural areas.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Science-Based Alternatives -->
        <h2>Science-Based Alternatives</h2>
        <h3>Keeping Schools Functional</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indoor vs. Outdoor Activities:</strong> Limit outdoor events like sports during high-pollution days while maintaining indoor classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Upgrades:</strong> Equip classrooms with air purifiers and ensure proper ventilation.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Attendance:</strong> Allow hybrid models for families concerned about health risks.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Customized Mask Usage</h3>
        <p>Avoid blanket mandates for masks in schools. Instead, recommend masks only for students with respiratory conditions or in poorly ventilated environments.</p>

        <!-- International Best Practices -->
        <h2>International Best Practices</h2>
        <h3>Beijing, China</h3>
        <p>Schools receive real-time alerts on air quality, suspending outdoor activities during severe pollution while continuing indoor classes.</p>

        <h3>South Korea</h3>
        <p>Mandates high-efficiency air purifiers in classrooms, with government subsidies for installation and maintenance in high-pollution areas.</p>

        <h3>California, USA</h3>
        <p>Parents can opt for their children to stay home during poor air quality days, but schools remain operational for those who wish to attend.</p>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Nelson Mandela once said, “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.” Addressing air pollution requires balancing children's health, education, and well-being. Science-based policies, equity-focused strategies, and long-term investments are essential to protect the future generation while tackling environmental challenges.</p>
