    Israel-Hezbollah Conflict: Analysis and Implications
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="section">
      The Israel-Hezbollah conflict has resurfaced amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, marking a significant escalation in regional tensions. Hezbollah’s involvement, including firing rockets into Israel in October 2023, has raised concerns about broader instability in the Middle East. This article explores the events, their implications, and possible resolutions, providing a balanced analysis of the conflict.
    </div>

    <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <strong>1. Hezbollah’s Involvement:</strong> In October 2023, Hezbollah entered the conflict, launching rockets into Israel in solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war.<br><br>
      <strong>2. Israeli Response:</strong> Israel initiated a ground invasion into Lebanon on October 1, 2024, aiming to neutralize Hezbollah’s capabilities.<br><br>
      <strong>3. Ceasefire Agreement:</strong> After two months of conflict, a ceasefire was brokered by the United States and France. Key terms included:
      <ul>
        <li>Israeli troops withdrawing to their side of the border.</li>
        <li>Hezbollah redeploying north of the Litani River.</li>
        <li>The Lebanese army assuming a mediatory role between the border and the Litani River.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Claims and Setbacks</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <strong>Claims of Victory:</strong> Both sides declared victory post-ceasefire:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Israel:</span> Claimed that Hezbollah had been weakened significantly.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Hezbollah:</span> Declared a “divine victory,” despite suffering heavy losses.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Setbacks for Both Sides:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Hezbollah lost top commanders, including its leader Hassan Nasrallah, and several strongholds were destroyed.</li>
        <li>Israel suffered high casualties and faced stiff resistance, with limited success in neutralizing Hezbollah’s rocket arsenal.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Continued Tensions</h2>
    <div class="section">
      On November 24, 2024, Hezbollah launched over 250 rockets into Israel, targeting high-security zones. Public sentiment remains skeptical about the effectiveness of the conflict, with a Channel 13 poll revealing that most Israelis believe Hezbollah has not been defeated. The fragile ceasefire is at risk of collapsing without robust conflict-prevention measures.
    </div>

    <h2>U.S. Role and Recommendations</h2>
    <div class="section">
      The United States has played a crucial role in mediating the ceasefire. However, further steps are needed to stabilize the region:
      <ul>
        <li>Pressure Israel and Hezbollah to adhere to the ceasefire terms.</li>
        <li>Prevent Hezbollah’s rearmament to avoid future escalations.</li>
        <li>Engage in diplomacy to address the root causes of the conflict, including Palestinian issues and border disputes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="conclusion">
      The Israel-Hezbollah conflict underscores the complexity of Middle Eastern geopolitics. While the ceasefire offers a temporary respite, long-term stability will require addressing deeper regional tensions. A multifaceted approach involving diplomacy, enforcement of ceasefire terms, and addressing humanitarian concerns is essential for sustainable peace.
