    Analysis of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955: Constitutional Concerns
</header>

<main>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 4:1 majority ruling by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India, in October 2024, upheld the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955. This provision allows migrants from former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) who settled in Assam before March 25, 1971, to acquire Indian citizenship. This article aims to critically analyze the judgment, pointing out constitutional concerns that were overlooked and discussing the potential negative implications for Assam's indigenous population.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Issues with the Ruling</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court's ruling has raised significant concerns regarding the application of constitutional provisions, particularly in relation to Articles 14 and 29.</p>

        <h3>Justification for Article 14 Test</h3>
        <p>The judgment attempts to justify singling out Assam for its unique migration challenges despite Assam’s smaller geographical area compared to other states like West Bengal, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. The Chief Justice of India, D.Y. Chandrachud, argued that Assam bears a disproportionate impact from migration due to its smaller population and land area. However, this argument appears arbitrary and fails to fully account for the broader context of migration across multiple states sharing borders with Bangladesh.</p>

        <h3>Contradictory Reasoning on Article 29</h3>
        <p>The Court’s reasoning on Article 29, which protects the cultural and linguistic rights of citizens, contradicts its findings on Article 14. The Court ruled that the influx of migrants did not harm the language or culture of Assamese people, despite evidence suggesting that such migration has led to significant cultural displacement. The contradiction between these two constitutional analyses raises doubts about the thoroughness of the ruling.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Background of Section 6A</h2>
        <p>Section 6A was introduced in 1985 as part of the Assam Accord to address the issue of migration from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The Accord sought to safeguard Assam’s local culture and prevent the overpopulation caused by migration.</p>
        
        <h3>Citizenship Criteria</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Before January 1, 1966: Migrants granted citizenship.</li>
            <li>Between January 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971: Citizenship granted after 10 years of residence.</li>
            <li>After March 25, 1971: Migrants were considered illegal and subject to deportation.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="important">
        <h2>Constitutional Concerns and Flaws in the Court’s Reasoning</h2>
        <p>One of the main criticisms of Section 6A is its violation of Article 29, which ensures the protection of cultural and linguistic identities. The Court argued that the mere presence of different ethnic groups does not infringe on the right to conserve culture, but this view overlooks the practical implications of large-scale migration.</p>
        
        <h3>Impact on Assamese Culture</h3>
        <p>Research on the changing demographics in Assam shows a significant shift in language composition between 1951 and 2011. The Bengali-speaking population increased by 36.36%, while the Assamese-speaking population decreased by 30.18%. This demographic shift signifies not only a change in language but also a broader cultural displacement that has eroded the unique identity of the Assamese people.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Temporal Unreasonableness and Manifest Arbitrariness</h2>
        <p>Section 6A has become temporally unreasonable due to the lack of any expiry date or conditions for its applicability. The law, introduced over 40 years ago, is still operational, rendering it ineffective in addressing the original concerns. This ongoing application, despite changing circumstances, highlights the law’s arbitrary nature.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Challenges in Implementation</h2>
        <p>One of the key challenges with Section 6A is the flawed mechanism for determining the citizenship status of migrants. The burden of initiating proceedings falls on the state, leading to an overwhelming number of cases referred to foreigners’ tribunals. The absence of deadlines and the backlog of cases further complicate the process, leading to inefficiency and confusion.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court's ruling upholding Section 6A seems to prioritize justifying the provision over objectively evaluating its constitutional impact. The judgment fails to address the significant cultural and demographic changes in Assam, which undermine the identity of indigenous Assamese people. Moreover, the law’s temporal unreasonableness and its flawed implementation contribute to its ineffectiveness. In its current form, Section 6A perpetuates arbitrary policies that do not align with the changing demographic realities of Assam.</p>
