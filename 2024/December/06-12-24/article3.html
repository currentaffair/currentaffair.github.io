    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            As per the 2011 Census of India, persons with disabilities constitute 2.21% of the population. However, this figure is widely regarded as an underestimation. 
            According to the 2019 Brief Disability Model Survey conducted by the WHO, severe disability prevalence in India stands at 16% among adults. 
        </p>
        <p>
            India ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) on October 1, 2007. This commitment required 
            legislative alignment with the convention's principles, culminating in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act of 2016, which replaced 
            the outdated 1995 Act. The RPWD Act promotes a human rights-centric model for disability inclusion.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Role of the State Commissioner</h2>
        <p>
            The RPWD Act introduced the office of State Commissioners for Disabilities, which combines review, monitoring, and quasi-judicial functions. 
            Under Section 82, these commissioners are empowered with civil court authority, enabling them to conduct judicial proceedings related to disability rights.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                The commissioners are tasked with addressing complaints, initiating suo motu inquiries, and recommending corrective measures for 
                violations of the RPWD Act. Despite these powers, their effectiveness varies significantly across states.
            </p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Challenges in Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            Many State Commissioners have failed to meet expectations due to inadequate support from state governments. 
            Key issues include delays in appointments, lack of independence, and insufficient capacity-building efforts. 
            For instance, the Chief Commissioner’s 2021-22 report highlighted that only eight states have appointed independent commissioners.
        </p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>
                The appointment of civil servants instead of independent experts contradicts the purpose of creating an impartial oversight office. 
                This compromises accountability and undermines the trust of persons with disabilities.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Recommendations for Improvement</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Appoint independent commissioners with expertise in law, human rights, or disability rights.</li>
            <li>Include women with disabilities to address intersectional discrimination.</li>
            <li>Provide consistent capacity-building programs in collaboration with law schools and NGOs.</li>
            <li>Encourage practices like mobile adalats to reach remote areas effectively.</li>
            <li>Ensure timely resolution of complaints and transparency through public dashboards.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Case Study: Karnataka’s Model</h2>
        <p>
            Karnataka’s State Commissioner’s office offers valuable insights into effective disability governance. Practices such as mobile adalats and 
            District Disability Management Reviews (DDMR) have improved complaint resolution and monitoring of welfare programs. 
            Collaborations with law schools have further enhanced the office's quasi-judicial functions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            To uphold the rights of persons with disabilities, State Commissioners must be empowered with independence, resources, and training. 
            States like Karnataka demonstrate the potential of proactive disability governance. By embracing transparency, stakeholder engagement, 
            and innovative practices, India can better align with the UNCRPD’s principles.
