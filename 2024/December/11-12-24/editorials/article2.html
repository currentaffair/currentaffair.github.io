    How to Make Self-Employment Count
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>India faces a low rate of participation in the workforce among its working-age population, with a stagnant labour force participation structure. A large proportion of the population, particularly in rural areas, is self-employed, with many working in agriculture and informal sectors. This article examines the key challenges and opportunities in enhancing the quality of self-employment in India, especially through vocational training, credit access, and legal support.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Characteristics of India’s Labour Force</h2>
    <p>India has a distinctive labour market structure with a greater share of self-employed workers compared to other middle-income economies. Over 50% of the working population in India is self-employed, with higher rates in rural areas (around 60%) and urban areas (approximately 40%).</p>
    <p>This pattern has remained stable over the years, largely driven by the dominance of agriculture and the country’s relative shift toward services, bypassing the manufacturing sector.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Self-Employment and Gender Gap</h2>
    <p>There is a stark gender gap in self-employment in India. Men are more likely to be own-account workers, while women often work as helpers in family-owned enterprises. Between 2017-18 and 2023-24, although the gender gap in own-account workers has decreased, the proportion of women in helper roles has risen, indicating a worrying trend towards informal employment.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Features of Self-Employment</h2>
    <p>The self-employed in India face several challenges, including low earnings and significant underemployment. Their earnings are often only slightly higher than those of casual labourers. Moreover, the gender gap in earnings has increased between 2017-18 and 2023-24, particularly in rural areas.</p>
    <p>Self-employed workers, especially women, work fewer than 40 hours per week, contributing to the high levels of underemployment in the sector. Many self-employed individuals resort to self-employment as a fallback when better opportunities are unavailable, especially in rural areas.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Constraints to Improving the Quality of Self-Employed Work</h2>
    <p>The barriers to improving the quality of self-employment are manifold:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Low education and skills:</strong> A large portion of self-employed workers lack formal education and vocational training.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor access to formal credit:</strong> Limited access to credit hampers the ability of self-employed individuals to expand their businesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor legal support:</strong> The complexity of India’s legal system makes it difficult for self-employed individuals to resolve business disputes efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These issues are especially pronounced among self-employed women, who face even greater barriers in accessing education, credit, and legal support.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Education and Vocational Training</h2>
    <p>Education and vocational training are critical for improving the quality of self-employment in India. In 2017-18, only 17% of self-employed individuals had completed high school or higher education, a figure that has marginally increased to 20.6% in 2023-24. The proportion is even lower for self-employed women, with just 11.4% having completed high school or beyond.</p>
    <p>Vocational training remains underutilized, with only 3% of self-employed individuals having any formal vocational training. Linking vocational training with entrepreneurship initiatives, such as the PM Mudra Yojana, can help bridge this gap.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Access to Formal Credit</h2>
    <p>Lack of access to formal credit markets limits the growth potential of self-employed individuals and their ability to scale their businesses. The absence of credit options forces self-employed workers to rely on informal loans, which are often costly and restrictive. This hampers the ability to invest in better tools, hire employees, or expand operations, limiting economic growth.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Administrative and Legal Support</h2>
    <p>Starting and operating a business in India remains a challenge, even with technical know-how and access to credit. The administrative and legal systems are complex, and self-employed individuals often face difficulties in enforcing contracts or seeking legal recourse in the event of disputes. The lack of efficient legal frameworks for small enterprises reduces overall productivity and inhibits entrepreneurship.</p>
</section>

<section class="conclusion">
    <h3>Conclusion and Way Forward</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, improving the quality of self-employment in India requires a holistic approach, focusing on vocational training, access to formal credit, and administrative and legal support. The government’s efforts to promote self-employment through schemes like PM Mudra Yojana and the push for better education and training infrastructure are steps in the right direction. However, addressing the underlying challenges such as gender disparity, lack of credit, and the complexity of legal frameworks is essential for creating a more inclusive and sustainable self-employment ecosystem.</p>
