        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>India has set ambitious goals for its space programme in the next two decades. The focus is on advanced, reusable rockets, including the Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV), developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). To secure strategic autonomy in space exploration, India is also leveraging its private sector to develop additional rockets.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>ISRO's Road Map</h2>
        <p>From humble beginnings in the 1960s, India has evolved into a powerful spacefaring nation. ISRO's upcoming Gaganyaan mission aims to send Indian astronauts into space, marking a significant milestone in India's human-spaceflight capabilities. By the end of the next decade, India plans to establish its own space station and expand its human-spaceflight capabilities to the moon.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Realising ISRO's Objectives</h2>
        <p>ISRO’s development plan includes conducting multiple uncrewed lunar missions, mastering human-centric technologies for space travel, and developing rockets capable of carrying heavier payloads. These rockets will be crucial for supporting long-term human missions to the moon and beyond.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Significance of the NGLV</h2>
        <p>The NGLV, set to triple the payload capacity of the LVM3 (India’s most powerful rocket), will play a critical role in India’s space ambitions. By offering heavy-lift and reusability, the NGLV will reduce weight and volume constraints, providing greater mission flexibility.</p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>Reusability will make space missions more cost-effective, as parts of the NGLV will be recovered and reused, reducing overall expenses. However, this comes with the challenge of reduced payload capacity due to fuel requirements for the return journey.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Private Sector Role in Space Exploration</h2>
        <p>ISRO has already contracted its private sector to help in the development of reusable, heavy-lift rockets. By encouraging foreign collaborations and implementing a milestone-based funding mechanism, the government aims to reduce costs and stimulate innovation in the space sector.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Challenges in Space Transportation</h2>
        <p>India’s current space capabilities are insufficient to meet growing demands. For example, India’s LVM3 rocket can only carry 4,000 kg to geostationary orbit, while private sector rockets such as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 can carry 5,500 kg. This gap in payload capacity underscores the importance of developing the NGLV.</p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>Comparing the capabilities of SpaceX’s rockets, including the reusable Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy, which can carry up to 21,000 kg to geostationary orbit, highlights the need for India to enhance its rocket development.</p>
        </div>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>India’s ambition to strengthen its space programme with the NGLV and the strategic involvement of the private sector is essential for maintaining its position in the global space race. By fostering a resilient space ecosystem and investing in the development of cutting-edge space technologies, India will be able to meet the growing demands of the space sector and secure its place as a leading space-faring nation.</p>
