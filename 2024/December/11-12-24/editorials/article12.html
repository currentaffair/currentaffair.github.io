<header>Syrian Civil War and Future of Syria</header>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Recently, Syrian rebels, led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), have claimed control of Homs, Syria's third-largest city, in a significant blow to President Bashar al-Assad's regime. This development, amidst the ongoing civil war, has raised concerns about Syria’s future, especially with growing challenges from various rebel factions.</p>

    <h3>Key Factors Shaping the Syrian Civil War</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Syria has been ruled by the Assad family since 1971, beginning with Hafez al-Assad. His son, Bashar al-Assad, continued the family’s authoritarian rule after Hafez's death in 2000. In 2011, during the Arab Spring, protests erupted, challenging the Assad regime. Initially peaceful, these protests escalated into an armed conflict as the regime responded with violent repression, leading to a full-scale civil war.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Rise of Rebel Factions</h3>
        <p>The conflict has seen the rise of various rebel factions, each with distinct goals. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly linked to al-Qaeda, has gained significant control over large parts of Syria, including major cities like Homs and Aleppo. Other groups, such as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA), have also played pivotal roles in opposing Assad’s regime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Foreign Influence</h3>
        <p>The Syrian conflict has attracted external actors, with Russia and Iran supporting Assad, while the US, Turkey, and Israel have backed various rebel factions. These foreign interventions have complicated the dynamics, as international powers pursue their own strategic interests in Syria.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>India's Approach to Syria</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Historical Ties and Diplomacy</h3>
        <p>India has historically maintained friendly relations with Syria, underpinned by shared civilizational ties and mutual support in international forums like the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Despite the ongoing conflict, India has continued diplomatic engagement with Syria, providing humanitarian aid and reaffirming its position on regional stability and the protection of minorities.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Implications of the Syrian Rebellion</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Impact on Syria and the Middle East</h3>
        <p>The rise of HTS and other rebel factions has raised fears of increased extremism in Syria, with parallels drawn to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Syria’s ethnic and sectarian diversity complicates efforts to establish a unified governance model. Furthermore, regional instability has had broader implications for neighboring countries, especially Turkey, which views Kurdish separatism as a significant threat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Global Impact</h3>
        <p>The conflict has triggered one of the largest refugee crises in modern history, with millions displaced. Moreover, the humanitarian crisis, terrorism, and economic disruptions have extended beyond the region, affecting global security and trade, especially in the oil market.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The Syrian Civil War is at a crossroads with Assad’s regime weakened and HTS asserting its influence. Syria’s future remains uncertain, marked by internal divisions, foreign interventions, and ongoing humanitarian crises. For countries like India, maintaining diplomatic neutrality while safeguarding national interests in a turbulent region will be crucial moving forward.</p>
