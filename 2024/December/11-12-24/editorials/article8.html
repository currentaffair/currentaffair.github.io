        Judicial Inaction in India: The Case of Sambhal Masjid
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In 2005, scholar Chad M. Oldfather discussed "judicial inactivism" and its consequences, noting how courts' failure to act could be as impactful as overstepping their authority. Judicial inaction, he suggests, often goes unnoticed but can have dire effects on the legal system.</p>
        <p>This paper explores a recent case in India—the Supreme Court's handling of the Sambhal Masjid issue—and its broader implications on judicial responsibility in the country.</p>
        
        <h3>Another Case of Judicial Deferment</h3>
        <p>The approach adopted by the Supreme Court in the Sambhal Masjid case exemplifies judicial deferment, where the Court chose not to address the core issue of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. Instead, it sent the matter back to a lower court for further consideration.</p>
        <p>The Court’s order, issued on November 29, 2023, called for a temporary halt on proceedings based on a survey conducted at the mosque. It also suggested other legal remedies, urging all parties to maintain peace and harmony.</p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>This decision, though intended to bring temporary relief, highlights a pattern of judicial hesitation in addressing key issues head-on.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Perils of Judicial Evasion</h3>
        <p>Judicial evasion, the act of deliberately avoiding decision-making on important matters, has led to significant issues in India’s legal history. The failure to enforce the Places of Worship Act, which prevents the conversion of places of worship, serves as a key example of this failure.</p>
        <p>The Sambhal case is a direct result of this evasion, as courts have repeatedly failed to address violations of the Act, leaving the issue unresolved despite its constitutional importance. This inaction contradicts the Act’s purpose of maintaining the religious fabric of the nation and preventing sectarian violence.</p>

        <h3>The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991</h3>
        <p>The Act was designed to protect the religious character of places of worship in India, ensuring that no place could be converted from one religion’s site to another. It also stipulates that no legal action can be taken concerning the religious character of places of worship as they were on August 15, 1947.</p>
        <p>However, the Act is not without exceptions. The Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, for instance, was explicitly exempted from the Act’s provisions. Moreover, violations of the Act are punishable with jail time and fines under Section 6.</p>

        <h3>Legislative Intent Behind the Act</h3>
        <p>The Act was enacted by Parliament to prevent the exploitation of religious sentiments for political gain. It aimed to end the historical practice of politicizing religious disputes, thus ensuring peace and secularism.</p>
        <p>Judicial deferment in the face of such legislation undermines these efforts and perpetuates uncertainty, as courts fail to provide finality in such cases.</p>

        <h3>Earlier Cases of Judicial Deferment</h3>
        <p>Cases like the Shaheen Bagh protest (2020) and the farmers' protests (2021) show the Court's tendency to defer decisions and avoid taking a stand on contentious issues. While the Court has tried to mediate between different parties, it has often failed to make a definitive ruling on the legal challenges at hand.</p>
        <p>This pattern of inaction has had lasting consequences, as legal questions remain unresolved, leaving social unrest in its wake.</p>

        <h3>Reluctance in the Sambhal Masjid Case</h3>
        <p>The refusal by the Supreme Court to adjudicate on the Sambhal Masjid case mirrors its earlier reluctance to resolve matters such as the farm laws and the CAA protests. The Court missed an opportunity to reinforce the validity of the 1991 Act, which would have reaffirmed the country’s commitment to secularism and national unity.</p>

        <h3>The Ayodhya Case Judgment and Its Implications</h3>
        <p>In the Ayodhya judgment, the Court upheld the secular values enshrined in the Places of Worship Act, acknowledging its constitutional importance. However, the Court's subsequent actions, such as allowing the survey in the Gyanvapi case, have contradicted this stance, undermining the Act's effectiveness.</p>

        <h3>Negation of Legal Findings in the Gyanvapi Case</h3>
        <p>In a sharp contradiction to the constitutional principles it earlier endorsed, the Supreme Court allowed a survey in the Gyanvapi Mosque case, thereby undermining the secular framework established by the Places of Worship Act.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion: A Lack of Judicial Will</h3>
            <p>The Sambhal case illustrates a continuing reluctance by the judiciary to confront crucial constitutional issues. By avoiding decisive action, the Court has failed to uphold the intent behind the Places of Worship Act. This inaction has contributed to prolonged uncertainty, and the upcoming hearing on December 12 presents another opportunity for the Court to correct its course and restore legal certainty.</p>
