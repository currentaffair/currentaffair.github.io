    National Mission for Natural Farming and City-Farmer Partnership
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        On November 25, 2024, the Government of India launched the <strong>National Mission for Natural Farming (NMNF)</strong> to reduce dependency on chemical fertilisers and promote organic farming among one crore farmers. The mission aims to train and support farmers transitioning to organic farming, with a special focus on using cow dung-based manure and other locally available non-chemical fertilisers. A key part of the mission is its potential integration with urban waste management systems under the <strong>Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)</strong>, offering an innovative solution that addresses challenges in both agriculture and waste management.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Challenges in NMNF Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        While NMNF has a noble vision, several challenges hamper its effective implementation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Exclusion of Urban Organic Compost:</strong> India generates 5.8 crore tonnes of solid waste annually, which could produce up to 1 crore tonnes of organic compost. However, this urban compost is not integrated into NMNF, limiting its potential impact on farmers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Environmental Impact of Current Waste Management:</strong> Unprocessed municipal waste, often sent to landfills, not only leads to environmental degradation but also causes methane emissions. The process of waste management is currently inefficient, with only 30-40% of waste being processed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Farmers’ Transportation Costs:</strong> Organic manure requires 2-3 tonnes per acre, significantly higher than the 100-150 kg of chemical fertilisers. The cost of transporting organic manure remains a challenge despite its lower price.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>City-Farmer Partnership Model</h2>
    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>City-Farmer Partnership Model</strong> links segregated urban wet waste with farmlands, allowing composting on-site at farms. This model not only solves waste management problems but also promotes sustainable farming.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Operational Framework</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Waste Collection and Supply:</strong> Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) deliver segregated wet waste directly to farmlands, bypassing traditional waste-processing plants.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>On-Farm Composting:</strong> Farmers use traditional pit composting methods, combining wet waste with cow dung slurry to produce compost within 2-3 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Impact Metrics:</strong> A city with 1 lakh people generates 10-15 tonnes of wet waste daily, which could produce enough compost for one farmer’s crop cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="important">Farmers:</span> Access to free organic manure at the farm, reducing transportation costs and improving soil health.</li>
        <li><span class="important">ULBs:</span> Savings on operational subsidies, reduced methane emissions, and improved waste processing efficiency.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Environmental Impact:</span> Less waste in landfills and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with SBM and NMNF objectives.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Case Study: Chikkaballapura, Karnataka</h2>
    <p>
        In Chikkaballapura, the City-Farmer Partnership Model successfully supplied 2,300 tonnes of segregated wet waste to over 200 farmers. This produced 600 tonnes of organic compost, leading to a 50-60 tonne reduction in chemical fertiliser use and improved soil health through rigorous testing.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <h3>Waste Segregation</h3>
    <p class="highlight">
        Challenge: Effective segregation of wet waste at the source remains a significant hurdle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Solution: Public awareness campaigns and strict enforcement of segregation norms can address this.
    </p>

    <h3>Farmer Training</h3>
    <p class="highlight">
        Challenge: Limited capacity for on-farm composting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Solution: Training initiatives led by self-help groups, NGOs, and government agencies are crucial.
    </p>

    <h3>Coordination Between Stakeholders</h3>
    <p class="highlight">
        Challenge: Ensuring seamless collaboration between ULBs, farmers, and waste-processing agencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Solution: Local partnerships, coupled with farmer incentives, are key to addressing this challenge.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>International Best Practices</h2>
    <p>
        Several countries have adopted innovative waste management practices that can serve as models for India:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Germany’s focus on circular economy and organic waste conversion into high-quality compost and biogas.</li>
        <li>Japan’s decentralized Takakura Composting Method widely adopted in urban areas.</li>
        <li>Sweden’s bio-cycle farming model using urban organic waste to produce bio-fertiliser and biogas.</li>
        <li>Singapore’s community-level composting hubs to manage organic waste sustainably.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Way Forward</h2>
    <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Integrate Urban Compost:</span> Include urban wet waste composting into NMNF to meet the manure needs of farmers.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Decentralized Waste Management:</span> Promote city-farmer partnerships for localized composting solutions.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Capacity Building:</span> Enhance farmer training on composting and soil health management.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Financial Incentives:</span> Provide subsidies for composting infrastructure and reduce operational costs for ULBs.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The National Mission for Natural Farming (NMNF) and the City-Farmer Partnership Model represent a transformative approach to addressing India’s agricultural and environmental challenges. Achieving NMNF’s target of supporting one crore farmers requires a collaborative effort across government agencies, ULBs, and local communities, ensuring a win-win outcome for agriculture, urban governance, and the environment.
