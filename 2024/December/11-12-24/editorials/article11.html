    National Mission for Natural Farming: Addressing Agricultural and Environmental Challenges
</header>

<main>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>On November 25, 2024, the Government of India launched the National Mission for Natural Farming (NMNF), aiming to reduce dependency on chemical fertilizers and promote organic farming. This mission targets training and supporting farmers transitioning to organic practices, focusing on cow dung-based manure and locally available non-chemical fertilizers.</p>
        <p>The integration of urban waste management systems under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) presents a potential solution to address challenges in both agriculture and waste management.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Challenges in NMNF Implementation</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Exclusion of Urban Organic Compost</h3>
            <p>India generates 5.8 crore tonnes of solid waste annually, with the potential to produce 1 crore tonnes of organic compost. However, urban compost from segregated waste is not yet integrated into NMNF, which could address the manure needs of 15-20 lakh farmers annually.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Environmental Impact of Current Waste Management</h3>
            <p>Unprocessed municipal waste often ends up in landfills near rural areas, causing environmental degradation and methane emissions. Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) process only 30-40% of waste, relying on operational subsidies to keep waste-processing facilities functional.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Farmers’ Transportation Costs</h3>
            <p>Organic manure requirements are significantly higher than chemical fertilizers (2-3 tonnes per acre compared to 100-150 kg), making transportation costs a barrier for farmers, despite organic manure being more affordable (₹2,000-3,000 per tonne).</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>City-Farmer Partnership Model</h2>
        <p>This innovative model links segregated urban wet waste with farmlands to enable on-site composting, reducing transportation costs while addressing waste management challenges.</p>
        
        <h3>Operational Framework</h3>
        <p><strong>Waste Collection and Supply:</strong> Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) deliver segregated wet waste directly to farms instead of processing plants.</p>
        <p><strong>On-Farm Composting:</strong> Farmers use traditional composting methods, combining wet waste with cow dung slurry and bio-cultures to produce organic compost within 2-3 months.</p>
        
        <div class="important">
            <h3>Impact Metrics</h3>
            <p>A city with a population of 1 lakh generates 10-15 tonnes of wet waste daily, enough to produce 3 tonnes of compost per day for a farmer’s crop cycle.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Farmers:</strong> Access to free organic manure, reducing transportation and input costs while improving soil health.</li>
            <li><strong>ULBs:</strong> Savings on operational subsidies, enhanced waste processing efficiency, and reduced methane emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Reduced landfill waste, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and alignment with SBM and NMNF goals.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Case Study: Chikkaballapura, Karnataka</h2>
        <p>The City-Farmer Partnership for Solid Waste Management (SWM) in Chikkaballapura has successfully supplied 2,300 tonnes of segregated wet waste to 200 farmers, producing 600 tonnes of organic compost.</p>
        <div class="important">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>The project reduced chemical fertilizer use by 50-60 tonnes and improved soil health through rigorous testing before and after composting.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Key Enablers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Farmer training programs.</li>
            <li>Close monitoring of composting processes.</li>
            <li>Collaboration between ULBs, farmers, and local organizations.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <h3>Waste Segregation</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring effective segregation of wet waste at the source.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Public awareness campaigns and strict enforcement of segregation norms.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Farmer Training</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Limited farmer capacity for on-farm composting.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Training initiatives through self-help groups (SHGs), NGOs, and government agencies.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Coordination Between Stakeholders</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring seamless collaboration between ULBs, farmers, and waste processing agencies.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Establishing local partnerships and incentivizing farmer participation.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>International Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Countries such as Germany, Japan, Sweden, and Singapore have established successful models for integrating organic waste management with agricultural practices. These countries focus on the circular economy and decentralized composting, offering valuable lessons for India.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Way Forward</h2>
        <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrate urban compost into NMNF to meet the manure needs of farmers.</li>
            <li>Promote decentralized city-farmer composting solutions.</li>
            <li>Strengthen farmer training programs in composting techniques and soil health management.</li>
            <li>Enhance waste segregation practices and infrastructure investment.</li>
            <li>Provide financial incentives for composting infrastructure on farms.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The National Mission for Natural Farming (NMNF) and the City-Farmer Partnership Model represent a transformative approach to addressing India’s agricultural and environmental challenges. Achieving NMNF’s target of supporting one crore farmers requires a collaborative effort across government agencies, ULBs, and local communities, ensuring a win-win outcome for agriculture, urban governance, and the environment.</p>
