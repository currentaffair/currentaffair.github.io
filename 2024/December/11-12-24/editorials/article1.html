        <h1>Critical Analysis: Women’s Safety and Workforce Participation</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Context:</h4>
        <p>The brutal killing of a female doctor at Kolkata’s R.G. Kar Hospital on August 9 has triggered the usual response of empty words and tired guidelines. <strong>The West Bengal government has issued guidelines, including minimizing night shifts for women, which raises important questions about safety and gender equality.</strong></p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Relevance:</h4>
        <p>Examined under the following key areas of General Studies:</p>
        <ul class="wp-block-list">
            <li>GS2: Welfare Schemes for Vulnerable Sections, and the Performance of these Schemes</li>
            <li>GS2: Issues Relating to Development and Management of Human Resources</li>
            <li>GS3: Growth, Development, and Employment</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Mains Question:</h4>
        <p>In light of the recent violence against women in their workplaces, reducing work hours of women and minimizing night shifts for them presents a way to ensure their safety. <span class="highlight">Comment critically.</span> (15 Marks, 250 Words).</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Women in Workforce:</h4>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024,h_804/https://www.legacyias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WLFPR-1024x804.jpg" alt="Women in Workforce Data" class="center-image" />
        </figure>
        <ul class="wp-block-list">
            <li><strong>The Worker Population Ratio (WPR) for women aged 15 years and above was estimated at 28.7% in 2019-20</strong>, according to the National Statistical Office (NSO).</li>
            <li>The Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for women reached 32.8% in 2021-22, but remains below the global average of 47%.</li>
            <li>The female LFPR in China is 60%, while in South Asian neighbors like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, it is higher than India's.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Night Duty - A Regressive Approach:</h4>
        <ul class="wp-block-list">
            <li>How does the guideline to “avoid night duty for women wherever possible” improve workplace safety?</li>
            <li>This regressive approach may push women out of the workforce, rather than addressing the root causes of workplace violence.</li>
            <li><strong>The Labour Force Participation Rate for urban women aged 15 and above in India was only 25.2% in April-June 2024</strong>, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey. Reducing work hours risks diminishing their financial independence.</li>
            <li>Other measures, such as safe zones, CCTV surveillance, and separate restrooms for women, should already have been in place to ensure safety without discrimination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Existing Notifications on the Issue:</h4>
        <ul class="wp-block-list">
            <li>States like Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Haryana allow women to work night shifts under regulated conditions.</li>
            <li>States like Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh outline conditions for exemptions to the Factories Act, ensuring women's equal opportunities in night shifts.</li>
            <li>Legal provisions that restrict female night shifts have been criticized as unconstitutional, with the Madras High Court striking down such laws in 1999.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensuring workplace diversity requires equal opportunities for all genders, including women in night shifts.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Way Forward:</h4>
        <ul class="wp-block-list">
            <li>The Supreme Court's national task force, formed after the Kolkata case, must address the larger issue of gender violence across sectors.</li>
            <li>Past reforms after high-profile cases like the 2012 Delhi rape incident have been inadequate to prevent crimes against women, with over 4.45 lakh cases still registered in recent years.</li>
            <li>Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud emphasizes that safety protocols must be actionable, not just words on paper.</li>
            <li>Public awareness and societal shifts are critical to promoting gender justice, as highlighted in key court judgments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>The "reclaim the night" campaigns reflect a strong demand for action on women’s rights and safety. Governments must heed these calls to ensure equality, security, and meaningful opportunities for all women.</p>
