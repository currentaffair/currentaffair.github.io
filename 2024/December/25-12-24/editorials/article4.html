    India’s Transition to a Green Economy: Challenges and Opportunities
</div>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="section">
        India is facing increasing challenges from climate change, including frequent floods, heatwaves, and agricultural instability. However, these challenges also present opportunities for India to drive a green economic transformation. India aims to achieve 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and is making significant advancements in areas such as green hydrogen and sustainable agriculture. Despite hurdles such as limited global climate finance and infrastructure gaps, India’s focus on renewable energy, sustainability, and urban resilience can position the country as a global leader in green economic growth.
    </div>

    <h2>What is the Green Economy?</h2>
    <div class="section">
        A Green Economy is one that fosters environmental sustainability, social inclusion, and economic growth at the same time. It focuses on reducing environmental risks and scarcities through investment in renewable energy, clean technologies, energy efficiency, and sustainable agriculture. The Green Economy aims to create jobs, improve well-being, and support sustainable development while minimizing harm to the environment.
    </div>

    <h2>India’s Green Economy Transition</h2>
    <h3>Climate Change Vulnerabilities Driving the Green Transition</h3>
    <div class="section">
        Frequent disasters, agricultural losses, and rising sea levels are compelling India to embrace renewable energy and sustainable practices. For instance, the 2023 floods in Himachal Pradesh highlighted the fragility of energy networks and accelerated India's push for renewable energy adoption. India's renewable energy capacity reached 203.18 GW in 2024, a 13.5% increase from the previous year, as part of the country’s goal of 500 GW by 2030.
    </div>

    <h3>Key Sectors Influencing the Transition</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="highlight">Agriculture:</span> Climate change has significantly impacted India’s agriculture, with erratic monsoons and temperature increases expected to reduce crop yields. Initiatives like Precision Farming and Zero-Budget Natural Farming are gaining momentum to combat these challenges.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Coastal Adaptation:</span> India's coastline faces significant threats from sea-level rise. In response, projects like the Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes (MISHTI) focus on nature-based solutions to safeguard coastal areas.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Urban Resilience:</span> Increasing heatwaves and rising cooling demands are pushing urban areas to adopt energy-efficient building codes and cooling technologies, such as those included in India’s National Cooling Action Plan (NCAP).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Challenges in the Green Economy Transition</h2>
    <div class="section">
        Despite the promising transition, India faces significant hurdles. These include insufficient renewable energy infrastructure, dependence on fossil fuels, financial constraints, and policy uncertainty. For example, India’s electricity generation still relies heavily on coal (77% as of FY23), hindering the shift to a green economy.
    </div>

    <h2>Measures to Accelerate the Transition</h2>
    <div class="section">
        To accelerate India’s green transition, several measures must be taken:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Scaling up renewable energy infrastructure:</span> Expanding solar and wind projects while upgrading grid systems.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Boosting green finance:</span> Expanding access to green financing through instruments like Sovereign Green Bonds.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Developing a green skills workforce:</span> Launching skill development programs to prepare workers for green economy jobs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="separator">Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="conclusion">
        India’s transition to a green economy is an urgent necessity for addressing climate change and securing long-term sustainable growth. The country’s renewable energy ambitions, coupled with green hydrogen projects and sustainable agricultural practices, will not only contribute to India’s development but will also set a global benchmark. However, this transition requires overcoming significant challenges, such as infrastructure gaps and financial limitations. With appropriate policy measures, financing mechanisms, and public engagement, India can achieve its green economy goals and contribute to global climate action.
