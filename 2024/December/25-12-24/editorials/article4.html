        Inclusivity in India's IT Sector
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>India’s IT sector is one of the fastest growing industries in the country, contributing over 7% to India’s GDP. This rapid growth has attracted attention from global markets, including sub-Saharan African countries, which look to replicate India’s success in software exports. The IT industry’s high-paying and performance-driven nature makes it a preferred career destination for millions of young Indians. It is often heralded as a model of skill-based meritocracy, where hiring is based solely on ability, and social background plays no role.</p>

        <h2>What NSSO Data Show</h2>
        <p>However, an empirical test of the inclusivity-promoting image of IT reveals a different reality. Analysis based on household surveys by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) shows that caste-based disparities still significantly affect employment opportunities and wage earnings within the IT sector. These findings suggest that social inequalities continue to shape the job market, even in sectors that claim to prioritize skill-based merit.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Study Methodology</h3>
            <p>The study utilized two rounds of NSSO surveys: the 78th (2020-21) and the 68th (2011-12). These surveys, representative at the national level, provide a large sample size for analysis, with 29,289 individuals included. Of these, 20,437 were drawn from the 78th round, and 8,852 were from the 68th round. The study controlled for observable factors that could influence employment outcomes, using industries dominated by the public sector as a benchmark for probability estimation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <p>The analysis revealed that the probability of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) being employed in the IT sector is only 10%, compared to 27% for upper castes. This disparity persists even when accounting for differences in educational attainment, gender, and regional background. Surprisingly, the gap in employment probabilities has widened over time, from a 6% probability for lower caste groups in 2011-12 to 10% in 2020-21, while the probability for upper castes rose from 17% to 27% during the same period. This indicates that as the IT sector grows, it has failed to address or acknowledge the social barriers that exclude marginalized groups.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Wage Disparities in the IT Sector</h3>
            <p>Wage disparities within the IT sector further compound the challenges faced by lower caste groups. SC and Other Backward Classes (OBC) workers face negative wage differentials of 24.9% and 22.5%, respectively, compared to upper caste workers. These disparities persist even after accounting for differences in educational attainment and type of employment. This indicates that caste-based labor market segmentation is a significant issue within the IT sector.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Labour Market Segmentation Theory</h3>
            <p>The findings support the labor market segmentation theory, which predicts that the market is divided into two segments: lower and upper segments. Workers in the lower segment face structural barriers that hinder their upward mobility, and this is reflected in the persistent caste-based disparities in the IT sector.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Gender Inequality</h3>
            <p>Gender inequality is another significant challenge in the IT sector. Female workers earn 26.2% less than male workers, regardless of their caste. While women’s employment probabilities in the IT sector are closer to those of men, they still face systemic wage discrimination. This highlights the intersectionality of discrimination in the sector, where both gender and caste play crucial roles in shaping labor market outcomes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Diversity and Its Impact</h3>
            <p>Workplace diversity is increasingly recognized as a source of competitive advantage. According to a 2022 report by the International Labour Organization, higher levels of diversity at the workplace are associated with greater productivity and innovation. The Network for Business Sustainability found that each 1% increase in racial diversity in management results in a productivity gain of $729 to $1,590 per worker annually. Despite this, the Indian IT sector’s reluctance to embrace true diversity risks stifling its potential for sustainable growth and discourages marginalized communities from investing in skill development.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>To address these deep-rooted inequalities, several policy steps are necessary. Firstly, transparency in workforce diversity should be mandated, requiring companies to disclose their diversity matrix publicly. This can encourage accountability without imposing quotas. Secondly, incentives and training for lower-caste entrepreneurs in high-productivity sectors should be prioritized to boost economic participation. Finally, bridging the skill gap among marginalized groups will help create a more inclusive job market, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of caste or gender, have an equal opportunity to succeed in India’s booming IT sector.</p>
