        Inclusivity in the IT Sector: Reality vs. Image
    </header>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The IT sector in India is a vital contributor to the nation's economy, with the industry accounting for over 7% of India's GDP. As one of the fastest-growing industries, it has become a global model, particularly in software exports, with even Sub-Saharan African countries looking to replicate India’s success. The sector is often seen as the pinnacle of skill-based meritocracy, offering high-paying jobs that attract millions of Indian youth. However, the reality may not align with this image of inclusivity.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What NSSO Data Shows</h2>
            <p>An empirical test conducted by analyzing NSSO household surveys challenges the notion that India's IT sector is inclusive. The data reveals significant caste-based disparities in employment probabilities and wage earnings in the sector, showing that social inequalities still persist in the job market despite the sector’s growth.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Study Methodology</h2>
            <p>The analysis is based on data from two rounds of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) surveys:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>NSS 78th round (2020-21)</li>
                <li>NSS 68th round (2011-12)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The sample size includes 29,289 individuals, with 20,437 from the NSS 78th round and 8,852 from the 68th round. These surveys are nationally representative and controlled for various factors that could influence employment outcomes.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>The probability of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) entering the IT sector is significantly lower than for upper-caste groups. While the probability for SC/ST was 10%, it was 27% for upper castes. This disparity has grown from 6% in 2011-12 to 17% in 2020-21, highlighting that the IT sector has not adequately addressed caste-based discrimination.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In contrast, upper-caste groups saw an increase in engagement probability in the IT sector, pointing to an exclusionary trend that is worsening over time despite the sector's growth.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Wage Disparities in the IT Sector</h2>
            <p>Even when lower-caste groups manage to enter the IT sector, they face significant wage disparities. SC and OBC workers earn 24.9% and 22.5% less than upper-caste workers, even after controlling for educational qualifications and employment type. This reflects the broader pattern of caste-based segmentation in the labor market.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Labour Market Segmentation Theory</h2>
            <p>The findings support the labour market segmentation theory, which suggests that workers in lower segments of the job market face systemic barriers to upward mobility. This segmentation relegates lower-caste workers to less prestigious, lower-paying positions, limiting their chances for growth despite their educational qualifications and skills.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Gender Inequality in IT</h2>
            <p>Gender inequality also persists in India's IT sector. Female workers earn 26.2% less than their male counterparts, regardless of caste. Although women’s employment probabilities are closer to those of men, the wage gap remains substantial, illustrating the additional layer of discrimination that women face in this sector.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Diversity and Its Impact</h2>
            <p>Diversity in the workplace has been shown to be a critical driver of innovation and productivity. Reports by the International Labour Organization (2022) and the Network for Business Sustainability show that diverse teams are more productive, with a 1% increase in racial diversity in management leading to an annual productivity gain of $729 to $1,590 per worker.</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>However, the Indian IT sector's reluctance to embrace true diversity hinders its potential for sustainable growth. Moreover, this exclusion discourages marginalized groups from investing in skills development, perpetuating cycles of poverty.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion: Policy Steps Needed</h2>
            <p>Several policy interventions are necessary to promote inclusivity in India's IT sector:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Publicly disclose workforce diversity matrices to increase transparency and accountability in the hiring process.</li>
                <li>Provide greater incentives and training for lower-caste entrepreneurs, encouraging their participation in high-productivity sectors.</li>
                <li>Bridge the skill gap among marginalized communities to foster a more inclusive job market.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By adopting these measures, India’s IT sector can become a more inclusive and equitable space, promoting sustainable growth while contributing to broader social justice goals.</p>
