        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India plays a crucial role in safeguarding human rights in the country. However, despite its significant mandate, the NHRC faces numerous challenges that hinder its effectiveness in addressing human rights violations. Recently, Justice (Retd.) V Ramasubramanian, a former Supreme Court judge, has been appointed as the new Chairperson of the NHRC, a position that had been vacant since June 2024. This article delves into the role, powers, and challenges of the NHRC and suggests measures to enhance its functioning.</p>

        <h3>What is the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)?</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>The NHRC was established on 12th October 1993 under the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993, which was later amended in 2006 and 2019. It operates in line with the Paris Principles, a set of international standards that promote and protect human rights. The NHRC works as an autonomous statutory body with the responsibility of safeguarding human rights through various mechanisms, including investigations, awareness programs, and advocacy.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Role and Functions</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intervention in Court Proceedings:</strong> The NHRC can intervene in court cases involving human rights violations with prior approval from the court.</li>
                <li><strong>Review of Safeguards:</strong> It analyzes constitutional provisions and existing laws concerning human rights and suggests improvements.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation of Inhibitors to Human Rights:</strong> The NHRC examines factors, such as terrorism, that hinder the enjoyment of human rights and proposes remedies.</li>
                <li><strong>Research and Promotion:</strong> The NHRC conducts research on human rights issues and promotes awareness through publications and seminars.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Powers of NHRC</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>The NHRC is vested with powers equivalent to those of a civil court, including ordering the discovery of documents, receiving evidence through affidavits, and requisitioning public records. It has its own investigation team, led by a Director General of Police, which can collaborate with central and state government officers, as well as NGOs, for investigations.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Challenges Related to NHRC</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Non-Binding Recommendations:</strong> One of the key challenges of the NHRC is that its recommendations are not legally binding. This limits its ability to enforce decisions and ensure compliance from the authorities.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Jurisdictional Limitations:</strong> The NHRC’s jurisdiction is limited to violations by public and private authorities, and it cannot address violations by private individuals. Additionally, its authority over cases involving armed forces is limited.</p>
            <p><strong>Lack of Enforcement Power:</strong> The NHRC lacks the power to penalize authorities for non-compliance with its recommendations.</p>
            <p><strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> The NHRC often faces challenges related to inadequate funding and staffing, limiting its ability to investigate effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Heavy Workload:</strong> The NHRC receives numerous complaints, overwhelming its capacity to address each case promptly.</p>
            <p><strong>Awareness and Accessibility:</strong> Many people are unaware of the NHRC’s functions, and the process of filing complaints can be cumbersome, especially for marginalized communities.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Measures to Enhance Effectiveness of NHRC</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Granting Enforcement Powers:</strong> Giving the NHRC the authority to enforce its recommendations would ensure better compliance.</li>
                <li><strong>Expanding Investigative Authority:</strong> The NHRC’s mandate should be extended to include violations by private individuals and entities, particularly in the corporate sector.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-bound Investigations:</strong> Introducing deadlines for investigations would ensure that human rights violations are addressed swiftly.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Financial Autonomy:</strong> Allocating an independent budget for the NHRC would help avoid external interference and improve operational efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressing Emerging Issues:</strong> The NHRC should adapt to emerging human rights issues, such as digital privacy and environmental rights.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The NHRC plays an essential role in safeguarding human rights, but its ability to function effectively is hampered by various challenges. By granting it enforcement powers, expanding its mandate, and addressing resource constraints, the NHRC could better serve its purpose of protecting the rights of vulnerable groups. The effectiveness of the NHRC is critical to ensuring that India’s commitment to human rights is reflected in practice.</p>
