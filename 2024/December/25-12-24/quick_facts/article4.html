        <h1>Fiscal Consolidation and Tobacco Taxation in India</h1>

        <h2>State Fiscal Health and Progress</h2>
        <p>The RBI report indicates state governments have made good progress in fiscal consolidation, maintaining gross fiscal deficits under 3% of GDP for three consecutive years (2021-2024). Revenue deficits have also remained low, allowing increased capital spending and improved expenditure quality.</p>

        <h2>Case Study: Delhi Government's Welfare vs. Fiscal Health</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Delhi's budget has grown from ₹30,940 crores (2014-15) to ₹76,000 crores (2024-25).</li>
            <li>GSDP increased from ₹4.95 lakh crores to ₹11.8 lakh crores during the same period.</li>
            <li>Debt-to-GDP ratio dropped from 6.4% (2013-14) to 3.9% (2023), one of India's lowest.</li>
            <li>Per capita income in Delhi grew from ₹2.47 lakh to ₹4.62 lakh between 2014-2024.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Subsidy Expenditure and Fiscal Health</h2>
        <p>The RBI report stresses the importance of rationalizing subsidy expenditures. Excessive subsidies may limit resources for vital sectors like infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which are key for long-term growth.</p>

        <h2>State Debt Status</h2>
        <p>State debt as a percentage of GDP has decreased from 31% (2021) to 28.5% (2024), but it remains above pre-pandemic levels. The RBI emphasizes fiscal consolidation to ensure long-term financial stability.</p>

        <h2>Recommendations for Improving State Finances</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Prioritize sectors like education, healthcare, and infrastructure over subsidies.</li>
            <li>Adopt clear strategies to reduce debt levels in line with FRBM guidelines.</li>
            <li>Implement outcome budgeting for better accountability and impact measurement.</li>
            <li>Include climate action in fiscal plans for sustainable growth.</li>
            <li>Improve fiscal data transparency to enhance risk assessment and reduce borrowing costs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tobacco Taxation for Public Health</h2>
        <p>The government is considering reducing GST rates on essentials and raising taxes on tobacco to address public health concerns, given tobacco's significant harm in India.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Higher Tobacco Taxes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher taxes discourage new users and encourage quitting, especially among young people and low-income groups.</li>
            <li>Generate revenue for public welfare programs like healthcare and education.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges in Tobacco Taxation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Different tax rates for tobacco products create substitution opportunities, particularly with bidis.</li>
            <li>Taxes must be adjusted regularly to keep pace with inflation and rising incomes.</li>
            <li>Bidis and smokeless tobacco should face the same tax rates as other tobacco products.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Proposed Reforms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement uniform tax rates across all tobacco products, including bidis and smokeless tobacco.</li>
            <li>Regularly adjust taxes to reflect inflation and rising incomes.</li>
            <li>Raise tobacco taxes to reduce consumption and improve public health.</li>
        </ul>
