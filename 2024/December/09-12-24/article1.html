            <p>On December 7, 2024, the government launched a 100-day campaign targeting 347 high-burden TB districts. This initiative aims to:</p>
            <ul>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subheading">Pradhan Mantri TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan (PMTBMBA)</div>

            <p>India has advanced TB treatment through the adoption of newer drugs and diagnostic technologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>New Drugs:</b> Bedaquiline and Delamanid have improved treatment outcomes for drug-resistant TB patients.</li>
                <li><b>BPaLM Regimen:</b> A shorter and effective 6-month treatment for drug-resistant TB, compared to conventional 19–20-month regimens.</li>
                <li><b>Molecular Diagnostic Machines:</b> India now has 8,293 molecular diagnostic machines in every district, a sharp rise from just a few hundred in 2014–15.</li>
                <li class="highlight">Indigenous molecular tests, endorsed by the WHO, were developed under the Make in India initiative.</li>

            <p>India’s efforts in TB elimination exemplify its leadership in global healthcare. From pioneering research to community-driven initiatives, the country has made remarkable progress. The intensified 100-day campaign underscores India’s collective commitment to eradicating TB. Moving forward, massive <i>Jan Bhagidari</i> in identification, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention remains crucial to achieving the goal of a TB-free India by 2025.</p>
