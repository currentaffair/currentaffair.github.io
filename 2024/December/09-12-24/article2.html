    <div class="title">Why RBI Isn’t Cutting Interest Rates</div>
    <div class="container">

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subheading">Introduction</div>
            <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently decided to leave the repo rate unchanged during its latest Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. While it lowered the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), signaling a potential rate cut in February, this decision highlights the complexities of managing inflation and growth amidst global and domestic uncertainties.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subheading">Inflation: A Persistent Challenge</div>
            <p>The RBI's stance is significantly influenced by the persistent challenge of inflation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="important">Headline CPI inflation breached the upper tolerance limit of 6% in October 2024.</li>
                <li>Retail food inflation saw sharp increases, with the cost of a vegetarian thali rising by 20% and a non-vegetarian thali by 5% in October.</li>
                <li>Non-food inflation remained relatively stable at 2.5% during April-October 2024, reflecting a year-on-year decline of 150 basis points.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subheading">Slower Economic Growth</div>
            <p>India’s economic growth has been slowing, presenting additional challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="highlight">GDP growth in Q2 FY25 was 5.4%, the slowest in seven quarters.</li>
                <li>The RBI revised its annual GDP growth forecast downward from 7.2% to 6.6%.</li>
                <li>Private consumption has slowed in urban areas due to high inflation and elevated interest rates, while rural consumption remains more resilient, supported by strong agricultural output.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subheading">Global Trends</div>
            <p>Global monetary policies have seen some easing, but challenges remain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) cut rates by 75 basis points each in 2024.</li>
                <li>Despite these cuts, the pace of monetary easing has been slower than expected, as inflation remains a persistent issue globally.</li>
                <li>Emerging market central banks, including India, are likely to monitor global developments before taking significant action.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subheading">Outlook for Monetary Policy</div>
            <p>The RBI's monetary policy outlook reflects a balancing act between inflation and growth:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Factors Favoring Rate Cuts:</b> A robust rabi crop may ease food inflation, while non-food commodity prices remain stable.</li>
                <li><b>Limitations:</b> Domestic growth momentum, though slowing, remains relatively healthy. Additionally, the global rate-cut cycle is expected to be shallow.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subheading">Policy Recommendations</div>
            <p>To address inflation and growth challenges effectively:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop a new CPI series based on the latest consumption surveys to better capture the impact of food prices on inflation.</li>
                <li>Fiscal policies should address structural and climate-related risks to food prices, ensuring durable solutions to food inflation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <div class="subheading">Conclusion</div>
            <p>The RBI and the government must navigate a delicate balance between inflation and growth. While easing food inflation and global monetary policies provide optimism, structural challenges require coordinated efforts. By prioritizing durable solutions, authorities can ensure stable economic growth without compromising price stability.</p>
