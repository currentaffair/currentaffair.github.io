        <p><strong>Relevance</strong>: GS 3 (Environment)</p>
        <p><strong><em>Practice Question:</em></strong></p>
        <p><em>Discuss potential causes for Delhi’s air pollution. Analyse current measures in reducing pollution levels and suggest key measures. (250 words)</em></p>

        <h3>Historical Context and Challenges:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Efforts to combat Delhi’s air pollution date back to <strong>1984</strong> with <strong>M.C. Mehta’s public interest litigation.</strong></li>
            <li>Despite many measures, the <strong>growing</strong> <strong>economy</strong> and <strong>population</strong> have outpaced these efforts.</li>
            <li>Urban toxicity is described as a ‘<strong>wicked problem’</strong> requiring long-term measures, similar to issues faced in <strong>Los Angeles.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Government and Judicial Actions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The National Green Tribunal (NGT)</strong> began addressing air pollution by asking the government to list its causes.</li>
            <li><strong>The National Clean Air Programme</strong> (<strong>2019</strong>), with its collaborative approach, has made minimal impact.</li>
            <li>The Supreme Court holds the <strong>right to a clean environment as a fundamental right</strong> and has been questioning the government’s efforts and the effectiveness of the <strong>Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sources of Pollution:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vehicular emissions</strong> and <strong>traffic congestion</strong> are significant contributors to year-round toxicity in Delhi.</li>
            <li>In Delhi, Los Angeles, and Beijing, 60% of air toxicity comes from vehicles, 20% from soil dust, and less than 20% from other sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Stubble burning</strong> contributes less than <strong>1%</strong> to <strong>Delhi’s PM 2.5</strong> levels on specific dates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges with Dispersed Sources:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Addressing dispersed pollution sources like vehicular emissions involves societal factors and lacks viable options.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical example</strong>: Rahul Bajaj and vehicle emission standards delays due to technological constraints from foreign collaborators.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Farmer’s Dilemma:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Farmers in Haryana and Punjab face challenges due to delayed sowing practices to conserve groundwater, affecting pollution levels in Delhi.</li>
            <li>The Supreme Court’s role isn’t to adjudicate between the fundamental rights of farmers and Delhi residents but to address management plans.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Comparison with Beijing:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Beijing employs a <strong>techno-political management system</strong> with public awareness, accurate monitoring, and preemptive measures.</li>
            <li>Beijing uses <strong>PM 2.5 sensors throughout the city</strong> and has significantly more public transport options compared to Delhi.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Court should mandate the <strong>Graded Response Action Plan</strong> and develop a toxicity management plan for Delhi and surrounding areas with proper budgetary and political support.</li>
            <li>Moving away from temporary solutions, a focus on transformative actions is necessary.</li>
        </ul>
