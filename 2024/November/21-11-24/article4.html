            <li><strong>October Rise</strong>: Exports rose by 17.25% in October to reach $39.2 billion, which is the second-highest monthly figure of the year; the Christmas season creates demand in developed economies.</li>

        <h3>Annual Target</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Annual Target</strong>: Exports of service have risen 14.6% by September, which boosts confidence in reaching the $800 billion target of 2024-25.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Petroleum Exports</strong>: A 25.6% increase, marking the highest-ever tally for the first seven months at $211.3 billion.</li>

            <li><strong>Oil Trade Deficit</strong>: The oil trade deficit hit $13.7 billion in October, which is a record.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Overall Trade Balance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Import Bill Increase</strong>: The total import bill rose to $66.3 billion in October, largely due to oil and gold imports.</li>
            <li><strong>Widening Trade Deficit</strong>: The trade deficit has expanded to its second and third-highest levels in the past three months.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forecasts</strong>: WTO predicts global trade growth at 3% in 2025, up from 2.7% in 2024.</li>
            <li><strong>Geopolitical Risks</strong>: Economic slowdown in China and ongoing global conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine crisis affecting trade stability.</li>
            <li><strong>U.S. Policy Shifts</strong>: There is speculation that the new government may put higher import tariffs and incentives for domestic production, which influences the global trade landscape.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Takeaways for India</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>India should be cautious in its policies; it should not attract unnecessary scrutiny from the United States.</li>
            <li>India should closely monitor oil market trends and focus on reducing oil import bills.</li>
            <li>India should focus on increasing non-petroleum exports.</li>
        </ul>
