        <p><strong>Relevance</strong>: GS 2( Polity ), GS 4 (Ethics)</p>
        <p><strong><em>Practice Question:</em></strong></p>
        <p><em>Explain why it is important for public figures to choose their words carefully. (150 Words)</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Context</strong>: The actor <strong>Kasthuri</strong> was recently arrested due to her remarks about the Telugu community at an event in Chennai. A few days later, bail was granted to her.</li>
            <li><strong>Importance of Public Speech</strong>: Public figures must be mindful of their words because today’s digital age enables permanently recorded statements and wide circulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Principles</strong>: Generally, the principle “bail is the rule and jail is an exception” should be considered, highlighting the importance of not using arrest as a first response in every situation.</li>
            <li><strong>Custodial Interrogation</strong>: In this case, there was no need for custodial interrogation since the basic material was already with the police, and there was no immediate threat to law and order.</li>
            <li><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong>: While freedom of expression is vital in a democratic society, it is bound by reasonable restrictions to ensure it does not harm others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Broader Implications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Responsible Speech</strong>: Public speakers should choose their words carefully to ensure their words do not negatively impact any community.</li>
            <li><strong>State Response</strong>: The state should consider arrest only when it is necessary instead of rushing for arrest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The case highlights the significance of balancing the Right to do (free speech) with the Right thing to do (social responsibility).</p>
