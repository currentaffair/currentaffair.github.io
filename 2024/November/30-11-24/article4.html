        <div class="title">Analysis of the Baku CoP Commitments and Climate Governance</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The <span class="highlight">Baku Conference of Parties (CoP)</span> ended with a roadmap, yet little tangible progress was made on climate commitments. This article critically analyzes the Baku commitments, emphasizing the financial and geopolitical challenges that hinder meaningful climate governance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>After two additional nights of negotiations, the CoP in Baku concluded with a roadmap, rather than significant progress on climate action.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Frustration</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing countries expressed dissatisfaction with unmet demands.</li>
                <li>Developed countries were content with the minimal commitments made.</li>
                <li>The global outlook remains concerning, with experts warning of a dangerous path ahead.</li>
                <li>Despite these setbacks, the CoP Presidency declared the event a success, citing limited advancements.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Financial Commitments</h2>
            <h3>Incremental Goal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The annual public finance goal for developing countries was raised from $100 billion to $300 billion by 2035.</li>
                <li>The total finance goal (public and private combined) was scaled to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Significant Gap</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The $300 billion target is only 20% of the demand initially made by developing countries.</li>
                <li>There were few substantial concessions that would enhance the actual impact of these funds.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Missed Opportunities</h2>
            <h3>Public Finance Priority Ignored</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The conference failed to prioritize affordable technology transfer from developed to developing countries.</li>
                <li>There was also an absence of robust support for infrastructure investments in vulnerable regions.</li>
                <li>If targeted public finance had been directed towards climate adaptation, it could have had a significant impact in the Global South.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Developed Nations’ Inaction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed countries showed a reluctance to take responsibility for meaningful climate action, backtracking on their previous commitments.</li>
                <li>They failed to discourage fossil-fuel-based development in the Global South, showing a double standard.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Geopolitical and Economic Shifts</h2>
            <h3>Broader Changes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The global solidarity needed for effective climate action is declining, exacerbated by a fragmented international order.</li>
                <li>Public and political support for climate action has waned in the West, further undermining collective efforts.</li>
                <li>Climate action is increasingly framed within the context of market competition, rather than as a global responsibility.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Climate Negotiations Entangled in Trade Conflicts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Political posturing, rather than action, dominated the discussions, further delaying progress.</li>
                <li>The potential impact of a future Trump presidency on U.S. climate commitments remains a major concern.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Symbolic Importance of CoP in Brazil</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The 1992 Earth Summit symbolizes the initial global commitment to climate action, emphasizing the need for concrete solutions, not just promises.</li>
                <li>The next CoP must focus on transformative climate solutions, emphasizing urgency and real action.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The Baku conference demonstrated inadequacies in global climate governance. Moving forward, there is a pressing need for efficient climate governance that prioritizes the needs of vulnerable countries and ensures real action on the climate crisis.</p>
