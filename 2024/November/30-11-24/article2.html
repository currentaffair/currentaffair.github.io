        The Constitution at 75: A Gift to India
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Indian Constitution, adopted on January 26, 1950, has been a cornerstone of India's democratic and sovereign identity. Celebrating its 75th year, it stands as a testament to the foresight and determination of India’s founding fathers. While the average lifespan of constitutions globally is just 17 years, the Indian Constitution has proven to be both durable and adaptable. This article explores its historical development, unique features, and the factors contributing to its longevity.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>The Government of India Act, 1935</h3>
            <p>The Government of India Act, 1935, was the last major legislative framework for British India. Despite being detailed, it was rejected by the Indian National Congress as an instrument of continued domination. Instead, the Congress advocated for a Constituent Assembly comprising elected Indians to draft an independent constitution.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Constituent Assembly</h3>
            <p>Post-World War II, the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946 laid the groundwork for a Constituent Assembly. The assembly, which began its sessions on December 9, 1946, included representatives from Congress, the Muslim League, and princely states. Despite initial challenges, such as the boycott by the Muslim League, the assembly persisted, marking a significant milestone in India's path to independence.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>Drafting the Constitution</h2>
        <p>The drafting process was a monumental task, spanning two years, 11 months, and 17 days. Under the leadership of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and the assistance of B.N. Rau and S.N. Mukherjee, the draft incorporated provisions from global constitutions, including those of the U.S., Australia, and Ireland. The final draft had 243 articles and 13 schedules, laying a detailed foundation for governance in a diverse and nascent nation.</p>

        <h2>Key Features and Adaptability</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Why Such a Detailed Constitution?</h3>
            <p>India's diversity necessitated a detailed framework to address its myriad languages, castes, and religions. Key chapters on Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles were included to balance individual freedoms with the state's objectives for social and economic justice.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Amendments and the Basic Structure Doctrine</h3>
            <p>In its 75-year journey, the Constitution has undergone 125 amendments, showcasing its flexibility. However, the Supreme Court’s Basic Structure Doctrine of 1973 serves as a safeguard, ensuring that the Constitution’s core principles remain inviolable.</p>
            <div class="important">
                <p>The Basic Structure Doctrine has been instrumental in preserving democratic values and ensuring the Constitution's resilience against potential overreach.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The Indian Constitution, a gift from the founding fathers, continues to guide the nation through its complexities. As India celebrates this milestone, it is crucial for governments at all levels to honor its principles by working towards the Directive Principles while safeguarding Fundamental Rights. This living document not only reflects India’s aspirations but also ensures its democratic future.</p>
