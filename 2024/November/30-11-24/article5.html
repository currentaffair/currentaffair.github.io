        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The <span class="highlight">International Criminal Court (ICC)</span> plays a pivotal role in addressing war crimes and genocide globally. This article focuses on its genesis and critically assesses its capacity to check genocide, especially in regions like West Asia and during conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Accusations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The ICC accuses Israeli leaders Netanyahu and Gallant of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, including mass starvation and targeting medical facilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Other Warrants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hamas leaders, Yahya Sinwar (deceased) and Mohammed Deif (reportedly deceased), are also accused of crimes related to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Impact of Warrants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The warrants restrict Netanyahu and Gallant’s international travel, as 124 countries under the Rome Statute are obligated to arrest them if they enter.</li>
                <li>The ICC’s lack of a police force makes arrests difficult without international cooperation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Israel’s Reaction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Netanyahu has dismissed the ICC warrant as “anti-Semitic,” while the U.S. has rejected the ICC’s decision, aligning with Israel’s stance.</li>
                <li>Israel defends its actions as counter-terrorism and compliant with international law.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Counter-Narrative</h2>
            <h3>Casualties in Gaza</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Over 44,000 deaths and more than 100,000 injuries have been reported.</li>
                <li>Displacement of Gaza’s population (2.3 million) continues to grow.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>International Opinions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The ICC has found “reasonable grounds” for the accusations against Israel.</li>
                <li>Previous measures from the ICJ and UNSC have called for ceasefires and measures to prevent genocide.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Diplomatic and Moral Implications</h2>
            <h3>Moral Stain</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Global criticism highlights humanitarian and ethical concerns regarding Israel’s actions in Gaza.</li>
                <li>The ICC warrants represent growing international disapproval of Israel’s conduct.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Isolation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The warrants complicate Israel’s diplomatic relations, increasing calls for diplomacy.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Broader Impacts</h2>
            <h3>Israel’s Allies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The U.S. continues to support Israel, contrasting with growing international pressure.</li>
                <li>Israel risks alienating other nations due to its perceived disproportionate military actions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Future Steps</h3>
            <p>Ending hostilities and engaging in diplomacy are critical for Israel’s long-term stability and reputation on the global stage.</p>
