  <div class="header">Climate Change Commitments at the Baku Conference: A Critical Review</div>

  <div class="content">
    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Introduction</div>
      <p>The Baku Conference of Parties (CoP) ended with a roadmap that many viewed as inadequate. While it highlighted some financial commitments, the overall lack of substantial progress left both developing and developed countries with mixed feelings. The global outlook on climate change remains urgent, but the commitment to real and transformative actions is lacking. This article delves into the details of the conference, the frustrations expressed by nations, and the broader implications for climate governance moving forward.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Context of the Baku CoP</div>
      <p>The Baku CoP witnessed long negotiations that ultimately resulted in an agreement many perceived as a mere roadmap, not a tangible breakthrough. The event did not generate the momentum expected from the global community, especially as the environmental crisis grows more urgent.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Frustration with Progress</div>
      <div class="highlight">
        <ul>
          <li>Developing countries voiced dissatisfaction with the minimal financial commitments made.</li>
          <li>Developed nations were content with the incremental goals, feeling that their responsibilities had been limited.</li>
          <li>Global outlook alarms indicated that the planet is on a dangerous trajectory without meaningful action.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Despite the CoP Presidency’s claims of success, many see the outcome as insufficient in addressing the pressing climate challenges of today.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Financial Commitments: A Closer Look</div>
      <p>One of the major commitments discussed at the Baku CoP was the scaling of financial support for climate action in developing countries. However, these financial commitments fell short of expectations.</p>
      
      <div class="highlight">
        <h4>Incremental Goal</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The public finance goal for developing countries was increased from $100 billion to $300 billion by 2035.</li>
          <li>The total finance, including both public and private sectors, was targeted to reach $1.3 trillion per year by 2035.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>While these figures represent an increase, they still fall significantly short of the demands made by developing countries. Many argue that the commitments do not reflect the urgency of the situation or the real costs of climate adaptation and mitigation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Missed Opportunities: Public Finance and Technology Transfer</div>
      <div class="highlight">
        <ul>
          <li>Affordable technology transfer from developed nations to developing ones was notably absent from discussions.</li>
          <li>There was a lack of robust support for infrastructure investment in vulnerable regions, particularly those in the Global South.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>The failure to address these critical issues indicates a missed opportunity to significantly improve climate resilience in the world’s most vulnerable regions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Developed Nations’ Inaction</div>
      <p>Despite their promises, developed countries failed to take meaningful action to reduce their emissions and provide the necessary financial resources for climate change mitigation. Instead, they avoided responsibility, which only exacerbates the inequalities in global climate governance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Geopolitical Shifts and Economic Pressures</div>
      <p>The CoP also revealed significant geopolitical and economic tensions that are now influencing climate change negotiations. A fragmented global order and declining support for climate action in the West have complicated efforts to build global consensus on addressing climate change.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Climate Negotiations Entangled in Trade Conflicts</div>
      <p>Climate negotiations have increasingly become entangled with trade conflicts. Political posturing and wordplay dominated discussions, leaving little room for real action. Future challenges, such as the potential impact of a U.S. leadership change, also threaten to derail global climate commitments.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">The Symbolic Importance of CoP in Brazil</div>
      <p>The upcoming CoP in Brazil will mark the 1992 Earth Summit anniversary, which was a pivotal moment in global climate policy. This serves as a reminder of the world’s initial commitment to climate action, which must now be revitalized to avoid further environmental degradation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Conclusion</div>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>The Baku CoP exposed the inadequacies of global climate governance. While financial commitments were made, they were insufficient to address the magnitude of the climate crisis. The global community must shift from symbolic gestures to substantive actions if it is to mitigate the impacts of climate change, especially for vulnerable countries.</p>
