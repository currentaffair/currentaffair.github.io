        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Women played a pivotal yet underappreciated role in the drafting of the Indian Constitution. Despite the pervasive patriarchal narratives of the time, individuals like Amrit Kaur, Hansa Mehta, and Begum Aizaz Rasul shaped critical aspects of the constitutional framework to champion gender equality and justice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Feminist Influence in the Constituent Assembly</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Women members viewed the Constitution as a transformative tool to secure <span class="highlight">gender justice</span>.</li>
                <li>Amrit Kaur and Hansa Mehta aligned with leaders like B.R. Ambedkar to challenge entrenched patriarchy.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Challenges in Achieving Gender Equality</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal laws that discriminate against women were retained, creating a dichotomy between public rights and private discrimination.</li>
                <li>Efforts to embed gender equality were limited by resistance to social reforms in family law.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Role of Secularism and Social Reforms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Founding Mothers emphasized the importance of secularism to protect women’s rights and ensure social progress.</li>
                <li>They worked to restrict religious practices that infringed on women's equality.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Uniform Civil Code (UCC)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hansa Mehta and Amrit Kaur advocated for the UCC to standardize laws and remove gender bias.</li>
                <li>However, the UCC was relegated to the Directive Principles of State Policy, limiting its enforceability.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Post-Independence Gender Equality</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The <span class="highlight">“Towards Equality”</span> report (1974) revealed a stark gap between legal promises and the lived reality of Indian women.</li>
                <li>Women’s representation in politics and law remains limited, delaying feminist reforms in governance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Continuing Struggle</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The dream of gender equality remains incomplete, with the UCC as a key unfulfilled promise.</li>
                <li>Institutional resistance and societal inertia hinder the realization of feminist aspirations for justice.</li>
            </ul>
