<header>Economic Inequality Crisis in India</header>

<div class="content">

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The economic inequality crisis in India has become one of the most pressing challenges in recent decades. Despite rapid economic growth, the wealth gap has widened significantly, leaving millions behind. The issue has its roots in colonial history, economic policies post-independence, and recent neoliberal reforms. This article delves into the factors driving inequality, the role of the Constitution, and the impact of social policies and economic reforms on wealth distribution.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Historical Context of Inequality</h2>
        <h3>Significance of Constitution Day</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Marks 75 years since the adoption of the Indian Constitution, a transformative document for governance.</li>
            <li>Highlights the inclusive and intellectual debates of the Constituent Assembly representing a wide ideological spectrum.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Liberty and the Role of the State</h2>
        <h3>Liberty and the State's Role</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Liberty:</strong> Essential for the realization of human potential, a core principle of the Constitution.</li>
            <li><strong>State’s Role:</strong> Essential intervention is necessary to reduce inequalities in post-Independence India.</li>
            <li>Balancing liberal values with welfare measures like affirmative action and reservations to ensure equality.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Egalitarian Vision of the Constitution</h2>
        <p>Inspired by <strong>John Rawls’ egalitarian liberalism</strong>, the Indian Constitution envisions an egalitarian society with the following principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Equal basic liberties for all citizens.</li>
            <li>Equal opportunities for all individuals.</li>
            <li>The difference principle, which mandates that benefits should go to the least advantaged members of society.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflected in Key Constitutional Provisions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Part III (Fundamental Rights): Guarantees individual freedoms for all citizens.</li>
            <li>Part IV (DPSPs): Directs state action to minimize inequalities and promote social justice.</li>
            <li>Article 38(2) and Article 39(c) explicitly mandate reducing income and wealth inequalities.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Judicial Interpretation of Egalitarian Ideals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>D.S. Nakara (1982):</strong> Advocated decent living standards and cradle-to-grave security for citizens.</li>
            <li><strong>Samatha Case (1997):</strong> Defined socialism as reducing income disparities and promoting equal opportunities for all citizens.</li>
            <li><strong>Justice Krishna Iyer’s interpretation of Article 39(b):</strong> Resources are community assets and should be distributed equitably.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Impact of Economic Reforms on Inequality</h2>
        <h3>Pre-1990s Welfare State</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced the top 1% income share from 21% (1930s) to 6% (1980s), indicating a more equitable wealth distribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Post-1990s Neoliberal Reforms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shift from welfare to market-oriented policies: Top 1% now controls 22.6% of total income (2022-23).</li>
            <li>Structural changes have favored private capital over equitable growth.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Evidence of Worsening Inequality</h2>
        <h3>Paris School of Economics (2024)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Top 1% wealth share: 40.1% (2022-23).</li>
            <li>Extreme inequality levels resemble pre-Independence disparities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>State of Inequality in India Report (2022)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The top 10% earn ₹25,000/month, while 90% earn less than this amount, highlighting the widening income gap.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Intersection of Economic and Social Inequalities</h2>
        <h3>Wealth Concentration by Caste</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>90% of billionaire wealth is held by upper castes.</li>
            <li>SCs (2.6%) and STs (0%) are underrepresented in terms of wealth ownership.</li>
            <li>OBC share of wealth reduced from 20% (2014) to 10% (2022).</li>
            <li>Rise of billionaires: From 9 in 2000 to 119 in 2023, illustrating the growing disparities.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Threat to Constitutional Vision</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neoliberal Policies:</strong> Undermine the welfare state, concentrating wealth and violating constitutional egalitarian principles.</li>
            <li><strong>Overlapping Inequalities:</strong> Social inequalities amplify economic disparities, perpetuating systemic advantages for dominant groups.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The economic inequality crisis in India is deeply tied to historical, social, and economic factors. The Constitution's egalitarian vision remains central to addressing this issue, but the current trajectory of neoliberal policies and growing social inequalities threatens its foundational principles. A critical reflection on policies and their alignment with constitutional ideals is essential to build a more equitable and just society.</p>
