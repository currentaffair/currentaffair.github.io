      <p><strong>Context</strong>: The Supreme Court of India has condemned the practice of demolishing the homes of individuals accused of crimes without due process, ruling that such demolitions are illegal and must follow the rule of law.</p>
      <p><strong>Relevance</strong>: GS 2( Governance )</p>
      <p><strong><em>Practice Question</em></strong><em>: Discuss the role of the Judiciary in checking arbitrary actions of the Executive, with a special focus on rulings against illegal demolitions. (150 words)</em></p>

      <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Key Issues</h3>
      <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li><strong>Delay in Action</strong>: The Court responded three years after demolitions began, raising concerns about timely justice.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li><strong>Redress for Past Demolitions</strong>: The judgment held state officials accountable, but it remains unclear if victims will receive compensation or justice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="wp-block-heading">State’s Dual Stance</h3>
      <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li><strong>Public Celebrations</strong>: Politicians and public figures often praised these demolitions as a form of instant justice, presenting them as swift actions to punish wrongdoers.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li><strong>State’s Justifications</strong>: In court, demolitions were explained as actions against “illegal” construction, not punishments, showing a conflict between political claims and legal arguments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Judgment Analysis</h3>
      <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li><strong>Guidelines for Transparency and Due Process</strong>: The Supreme Court introduced a set of guidelines aimed at ensuring fairness in demolitions. These include:
          <ul>
            <li>Providing notice and time for the affected individuals to respond.</li>
            <li>Ensuring personal hearings and the right to appeal.</li>
            <li>Demolition decisions must be proportional, meaning they should not be excessive or arbitrary.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Concerns and Future Steps</h3>
      <p><strong>Vulnerable Populations:</strong> The ruling excluded some structures on public land from due process protections, potentially leaving marginalized communities more at risk of demolition.</p>
      <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The effectiveness of these guidelines depends on how well courts and authorities enforce them. Without proper enforcement, demolitions could continue under the pretense of legality.</p>

      <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the rule of law once again by checking arbitrary action by the executives. Now, focus should be on efficient enforcement and compensating past victims.</p>
