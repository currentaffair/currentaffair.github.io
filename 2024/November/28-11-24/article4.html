    <main>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            India's electoral system, established in 1949 under its Constitution, has been a cornerstone of the world’s largest democracy. 
            While it has made remarkable strides in strengthening democratic governance, significant challenges persist, such as political 
            criminalization, unchecked money power, and voter apathy. Comprehensive electoral reforms are essential to address these issues 
            and uphold democratic integrity.
        </p>

        <h2>Evolution of India's Electoral System</h2>
        <h3>Pre-Independence Era</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>
                The roots of India’s electoral framework trace back to the colonial period:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Government of India Act, 1858:</strong> British Crown assumed control; no representative governance existed.</li>
                <li><strong>Indian Councils Act, 1861 & 1892:</strong> Allowed limited Indian participation in legislative councils but no direct elections.</li>
                <li><strong>Morley-Minto Reforms, 1909:</strong> Introduced communal representation and separate electorates for Muslims.</li>
                <li><strong>Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, 1919:</strong> Expanded the electorate and allowed limited provincial representation.</li>
                <li><strong>Government of India Act, 1935:</strong> Established provincial autonomy and expanded electorates significantly.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Post-Independence Era</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>
                With independence, India adopted universal adult suffrage as a fundamental principle, guaranteeing inclusivity in its electoral process.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Constitutional Provisions:</strong> Articles 324–329 lay the foundation for election oversight and framework.</li>
                <li><strong>First General Elections (1951-52):</strong> Over 173 million voters participated, 85% of whom were illiterate, necessitating innovative measures like symbols for parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Reforms:</strong> Reduction of the voting age (1989), introduction of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), and voter verifiable paper audit trails (VVPATs).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Challenges in India's Electoral System</h2>
        <h3>Money Power and Opacity</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            A report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) reveals that nearly 60% of political funds come from untraceable sources. Electoral bonds alone have accounted for over ₹16,000 crores in contributions.
        </div>

        <h3>Criminalization of Politics</h3>
        <p>
            A 2024 ADR report highlights that 46% of newly elected Lok Sabha MPs have criminal charges, with 27 already convicted. Weak enforcement of judicial directives exacerbates this issue.
        </p>

        <h3>Voter Apathy</h3>
        <p>
            Urban voter turnout remains dismal, with cities like Bengaluru reporting just 54%. The 2023 elections saw a 2.9% decline in overall voter turnout compared to 2019.
        </p>

        <h3>Election Commission's Independence</h3>
        <div class="important">
            In 2023, the Supreme Court mandated a selection committee for the Chief Election Commissioner to bolster autonomy. However, concerns about the EC's credibility persist.
        </div>

        <h2>Recommendations for Reform</h2>
        <h3>Addressing Criminalization</h3>
        <p>
            Amend the Representation of the People Act to disqualify candidates with serious criminal charges until acquitted by a fast-track court.
        </p>

        <h3>Strengthening EC Independence</h3>
        <p>
            Provide financial autonomy and regular audits by independent bodies to ensure the EC remains impartial and credible.
        </p>

        <h3>Boosting Voter Turnout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduce online registration and remote voting for migrant workers.</li>
            <li>Enhance awareness campaigns targeting urban voters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Eco-Friendly Campaigning</h3>
        <p>
            Mandate biodegradable materials for campaign posters and promote digital campaigning to minimize environmental impact.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                Strengthening India's electoral system requires addressing systemic flaws like criminalization, voter apathy, and electoral opacity. 
                By promoting transparency, leveraging technology, and fostering accountability, India can set a global benchmark for democratic 
                governance and inclusivity.
