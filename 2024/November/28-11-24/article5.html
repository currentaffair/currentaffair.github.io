<header>The Constitution at 75: A Gift to the People of India</header>

<main>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Indian Constitution, crafted as the foundation of India’s democracy, has withstood the test of time for 75 years. Despite global trends of constitutional replacement, the Indian Constitution remains a symbol of resilience and adaptability, reflecting the foresight of its framers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Longevity of the Indian Constitution</h2>
        <p>Globally, the average lifespan of constitutions is just 17 years. In South Asia, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sri Lanka replaced its constitution three times.</li>
            <li>Pakistan adopted six different constitutions.</li>
            <li>Nepal rewrote its constitution five times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In contrast, India's Constitution has remained intact for 75 years, undergoing amendments to adapt to changing societal needs. This longevity is a testament to the vision of India’s founding fathers and the dynamic yet stable nature of its constitutional framework.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Foundations: Government of India Act, 1935</h2>
        <p>The Government of India Act, 1935, served as the bedrock for India’s constitutional development. While the Indian National Congress rejected it in 1936 for perpetuating colonial dominance, its structural elements became the basis for India’s post-independence governance framework.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Formation of the Constituent Assembly</h2>
        <p>In the aftermath of World War II, it became evident that India’s independence was imminent. The <span class="highlight">Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946</span> proposed the creation of a Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution for a unified India. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Congress, Muslim League, and princely states were to collaborate.</li>
            <li>The Muslim League boycotted the assembly, leading to a divided India.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Constituent Assembly convened its first session on December 9, 1946, and began the historic process of drafting the Constitution.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Drafting the Constitution</h2>
        <p>The drafting process took <strong>2 years, 11 months, and 17 days</strong>, involving 141 working days. The drafting committee, chaired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, relied on the expertise of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>B.N. Rau, Constitutional Adviser</li>
            <li>S.N. Mukherjee, Chief Draftsman</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The draft contained 243 articles and 13 schedules, drawing inspiration from constitutions of the USA, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and Japan.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Indian Independence Act, 1947</h2>
        <p>India attained freedom on August 15, 1947. The Indian Independence Act empowered the Constituent Assembly to perform dual functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drafting a new Constitution</li>
            <li>Functioning as the federal legislature under the Government of India Act, 1935</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ironically, the much-criticized Government of India Act, 1935, became the structural foundation for independent India’s Constitution.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Unique Features of the Constitution</h2>
        <p>India’s Constitution, one of the world’s longest, addressed the complexities of a diverse nation. Key features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapters on Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles</li>
            <li>A parliamentary system of government with federal characteristics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These provisions were essential for a nation with no established conventions and vast linguistic, religious, and cultural diversity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Amendments and Basic Structure Doctrine</h2>
        <p>With <strong>125 amendments</strong> over 75 years, the Constitution has demonstrated its flexibility and relevance. The <span class="highlight">Basic Structure Doctrine</span>, established by the Supreme Court on April 24, 1973, ensures that no amendment can alter its essential features, safeguarding its core principles for future generations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion and Way Forward</h2>
        <p>The Indian Constitution remains one of the greatest achievements of the nation, balancing rigidity with adaptability. As India progresses, it is incumbent upon governments to adhere to its principles, ensuring that Directive Principles are implemented without compromising Fundamental Rights. The legacy of the Constitution is not only its survival but its continuous evolution, reflecting the aspirations of a diverse and dynamic society.</p>
