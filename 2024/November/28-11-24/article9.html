        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> GS 2 (Indian Polity)</p>
        <p><strong><em>Practice Question:</em></strong><em> Discuss the role of the Uniform Civil Code in ensuring gender equality. Suggest key measures for its implementation. (250 Words)</em></p>

        <h3>Women’s Role in Drafting the Indian Constitution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Women’s role as ‘founding mothers’ in drafting the Indian Constitution has been overshadowed by patriarchal narratives.</li>
            <li>Amrit Kaur, Hansa Mehta, and Begum Aizaz Rasul played crucial roles in shaping the Constitution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Feminist Influence in the Constituent Assembly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Women members emphasised that the Constitution is a tool to secure gender justice and equality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Despite their efforts, the Constitution allowed personal laws that discriminated against women in family matters.</li>
            <li>This created a rift between women’s rights in the public domain versus traditional practices in the private sphere.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Intersectional Alliances</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Founding mothers like Amrit Kaur and Hansa Mehta formed alliances with leaders such as B.R. Ambedkar to challenge societal norms.</li>
            <li>They sought a transformation of society, challenging deep-rooted patriarchy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Social Reforms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The role of secularism in the Constitution was emphasised as a means to protect women’s rights and ensure social reforms.</li>
            <li>The Founding Mothers worked to limit religious freedoms that could infringe upon women’s equality and progress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Uniform Civil Code (UCC)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Women like Hansa Mehta and Amrit Kaur advocated for the inclusion of the Uniform Civil Code to standardise laws, remove gender-based descriptions, and eliminate biased laws.</li>
            <li>However, the UCC was placed in the Directive Principles of State Policy, limiting its immediate enforcement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Post-Independence Gender Equality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Despite the guarantees from the Constitution, the dream of gender equality has faced numerous challenges.</li>
            <li>Reports such as <strong>“Towards Equality” in 1974</strong> discussed the huge gap between legal promises and the reality for women.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Continuing Struggle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The role of women in politics and law has remained limited, hindering the advancement of feminist goals in governance.</li>
            <li>The implementation of a Uniform Civil Code remains a key unfulfilled promise for gender justice.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The journey towards gender equality in India has faced several hurdles despite the constitutional promises. The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is an essential tool in ensuring gender justice by eliminating discriminatory laws based on personal belief systems. Its implementation, though challenging, remains crucial in establishing true equality for women in all spheres of life.</p>
