    <div class="title">Rethinking School Closures Under GRAP Measures</div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>In November 2024, schools in Delhi were asked to shift to online mode under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) when the Air Quality Index (AQI) reached “poor” levels. While such measures aim to mitigate air pollution, the rationale and practicality of shifting schools to online mode warrant critical evaluation. This article delves into the health implications of poor air quality, the limitations of online learning, and the broader societal consequences of such policies.</p>
        
        <h2>The Harmful Effects of Poor Air Quality</h2>
        <p>The impact of poor air quality extends beyond children to all age groups. According to Indian AQI norms, air quality above 50 begins to pose health risks. Notably:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Delhi has not experienced a single day of “good” air quality in 2024.</span></li>
            <li>In 2023, there was only one day classified as having “good” air quality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The assumption that AQI levels below 400 are less harmful inadvertently normalizes the adverse effects of moderately poor air quality (AQI 51–399).</p>

        <h2>Indoor Air Quality and Children's Welfare</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Children in underprivileged households may experience better air quality in classrooms equipped with air purifiers compared to their homes. However, shifting to online education exacerbates learning disparities and results in the loss of mid-day meals for many children. This highlights the need for careful consideration before mandating school closures.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Limitations of Online Classes</h2>
        <p>Online classes have proven to be inadequate substitutes for physical schooling. Key drawbacks include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Younger children are exposed to excessive screen time, contradicting health guidelines.</li>
            <li>Only EdTech platforms benefit from this shift, while students face learning and developmental losses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Importance of Keeping Schools Open</h2>
        <p>Physical schools are not merely places for academic learning; they foster holistic development. Lessons from the prolonged COVID-19 lockdown underscore the negative impact of extended school closures. Ensuring the continuity of physical classes is essential for equitable education.</p>

        <h2>The Oversold Concept of Face Masks</h2>
        <p>While face masks are often recommended during high pollution levels, uniform mask mandates for children lack sufficient scientific backing. Notable points include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Masks are not recommended for children under five years old.</li>
            <li>Children aged 6–11 may benefit from masks but are not mandated to wear them.</li>
            <li>In schools with air purifiers, masks offer negligible additional protection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Face mask guidelines should be nuanced, considering individual health conditions and expert recommendations.</p>

        <h2>A Science-Based Approach</h2>
        <p>To address air quality concerns without disrupting education:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Avoid online schooling regardless of AQI levels.</span></li>
            <li>Halt outdoor activities during poor AQI days while maintaining physical classes indoors.</li>
            <li>Ensure classrooms with air purifiers are properly sealed and ventilated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Policy Recommendations</h2>
        <p>GRAP measures should prioritize equity and protect vulnerable populations. Policies must address the disproportionate impact on underprivileged communities while avoiding blanket solutions such as school closures.</p>

        <h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Schools are not significant contributors to air pollution, and their closure under GRAP measures causes more harm than good. A nuanced, people-centric approach is essential to balance health, education, and equity. As Nelson Mandela aptly stated, “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.” It is time for India to reflect on its policies and prioritize the welfare of its future generations.</p>
