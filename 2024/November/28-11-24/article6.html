        <h2>China’s Military Rise and Regional Security</h2>
        <h3>Defence Build-up</h3>
        <p>China has invested heavily in its military over the last three decades, achieving significant advancements in technology and capabilities.</p>

        <h3>Territorial Assertiveness</h3>
        <p>China continues to assert territorial claims, causing friction with neighboring countries. This approach underscores its regional ambitions and challenges for Asian security.</p>

        <h3>Diplomatic Shifts</h3>

    <section>
        <h2>The Role of the United States</h2>
        <h3>Challenges to US Dominance</h3>
        <p>The growing power of China's military is eroding US dominance in East Asia. While the US maintains technological superiority, China’s numerical and strategic advances are reshaping the balance.</p>

        <h3>Strategic Focus on Asia</h3>
        <p>The US has increased its focus on Asia's security, though its commitments in Europe and the Middle East pose challenges in concentrating resources.</p>

        <h3>Resource Constraints</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Multiple conflicts have strained the US military's capacity. Aging production facilities and a lack of skilled personnel are key issues, pushing the US to collaborate with allies like Japan and South Korea to meet defence demands.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>India’s Strategic Response</h2>
        <h3>Modernizing the Defence Sector</h3>
        <p>India has signed defence industrial roadmaps with the US and France, with plans to expand partnerships with other nations like Italy. Efforts are underway to involve the private sector in defence production, aiming to increase arms exports.</p>

        <h3>Reforming Defence Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is undergoing restructuring to improve efficiency. However, accelerating modernization efforts remains critical to narrowing the technological gap with China.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>India must expedite defence reforms and capitalize on opportunities to transform its defence industrial base. As China continues to expand its capabilities, a robust and modernized defence sector is crucial for India to maintain regional stability and security.</p>
