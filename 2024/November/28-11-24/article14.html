        Economic Inequality Crisis in India: A Constitutional Perspective
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong>: The issue of economic inequality has been a persistent challenge in India, deeply influencing its socio-political landscape. As the country continues to grow economically, stark disparities in wealth distribution have emerged, raising concerns about the effectiveness of existing policies. This article explores the constitutional vision on inequality and assesses the role of economic reforms in exacerbating or alleviating these issues.</p>

        <h3>Significance of Constitution Day</h3>
        <p>The celebration of Constitution Day marks 75 years since the adoption of India's transformative Constitution. It underscores the intellectual debates that shaped the document, which sought to build a just society through principles of equality and liberty.</p>

        <h3>Liberty and the Role of the State</h3>
        <p><strong>Liberty</strong> is fundamental to the realization of human potential, whereas the <strong>State’s Role</strong> is essential in ensuring that this potential is realized equitably. The Indian state’s intervention through welfare measures, affirmative action, and reservations aims to balance individual freedoms with the collective good, addressing historical injustices and promoting equality.</p>

        <h3>Egalitarian Vision of the Constitution</h3>
        <p>The Constitution of India draws inspiration from John Rawls' theory of egalitarian liberalism, which emphasizes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Equal basic liberties for all citizens.</li>
            <li>Equal opportunities for social and economic advancement.</li>
            <li>The "Difference Principle" - benefits should be directed toward the least advantaged.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Constitutional Provisions</h3>
        <p>The Constitution’s commitment to reducing inequality is enshrined in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Part III</strong> (Fundamental Rights): Guarantees individual freedoms and rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Part IV</strong> (Directive Principles of State Policy): Directs the State to minimize inequalities in income and wealth.</li>
            <li><strong>Article 38(2)</strong> and <strong>Article 39(c)</strong>: Explicitly mandate the reduction of income and wealth inequalities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Judicial Interpretation of Egalitarian Ideals</h3>
        <p>The judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting the Constitution’s egalitarian ideals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>D.S. Nakara (1982)</strong>: Advocated for decent living standards and comprehensive social security.</li>
            <li><strong>Samatha Case (1997)</strong>: Emphasized the importance of reducing income disparities and ensuring equal opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Justice Krishna Iyer’s interpretation of Article 39(b)</strong>: Interpreted state resources as community assets meant for equitable distribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact of Economic Reforms on Inequality</h3>
        <p><strong>Pre-1990s Welfare State:</strong> The welfare state reduced the share of income held by the top 1%, from 21% in the 1930s to 6% by the 1980s.</p>
        <p><strong>Post-1990s Neoliberal Reforms:</strong> The shift to market-oriented policies led to a dramatic increase in inequality. By 2022-23, the top 1% controlled 22.6% of India's total income, with structural changes favoring private capital over equitable growth.</p>

        <h3>Evidence of Worsening Inequality</h3>
        <p>Recent reports highlight a growing concentration of wealth in the hands of a few:</p>
        <h4>Paris School of Economics (2024)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Top 1% wealth share: 40.1% (2022-23).</li>
            <li>Extreme inequality levels now resemble those before India’s independence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>State of Inequality in India Report (2022)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The top 10% of earners make ₹25,000/month, while the remaining 90% earn significantly less.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Intersection of Economic and Social Inequalities</h3>
        <p><strong>Wealth Concentration by Caste:</strong> A deepening divide between social groups has exacerbated wealth inequality. Upper castes hold 90% of billionaire wealth, while SCs and STs remain underrepresented, and OBCs have seen their share of wealth decrease significantly.</p>

        <h3>Threat to Constitutional Vision</h3>
        <p>Neoliberal policies, which prioritize market-driven growth, undermine the welfare state and violate the egalitarian principles outlined in the Constitution. Additionally, the overlap between social and economic inequalities further exacerbates these disparities, reinforcing systemic advantages for dominant groups.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The rising economic inequality in India challenges the constitutional vision of a just and egalitarian society. There is an urgent need for reflection on current policies to ensure that they align with the ideals of equality, liberty, and justice. As Dr. B.R. Ambedkar warned, social and economic inequality threatens the very foundations of democracy. It is time to reaffirm our commitment to constitutional values and take action to create a more equitable society.</p>
