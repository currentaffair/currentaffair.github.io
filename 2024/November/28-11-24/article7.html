    <div class="title">India's Ranitidine Dilemma: A Call for Regulatory Action</div>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>In a significant development, GSK recently settled lawsuits worth $2.2 billion in the United States regarding its popular acid reflux drug, Zantac®, containing ranitidine. The lawsuits were based on findings that the drug contained high levels of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a carcinogen. While global regulatory bodies like the FDA and EMA have taken action, India's Ministry of Health has not yet addressed the issue. This article explores the implications of continued ranitidine use in India, evaluates regulatory lapses, and advocates for science-backed reforms.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- The NDMA Controversy -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">The NDMA Controversy</h2>
            <p>The carcinogenic risk associated with ranitidine stems from <span class="highlight">NDMA levels exceeding 3,000,000 nanograms</span>, as detected by Valisure, a U.S.-based pharmacy. For context, the acceptable limit for NDMA in the U.S. is just 96 nanograms. NDMA is a well-known carcinogen linked to liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal cancers.</p>
            <p>The issue is not limited to GSK, as the instability of the ranitidine molecule causes NDMA formation across brands. Consequently, the drug has been banned in multiple jurisdictions worldwide since 2020.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Regulatory Inaction in India -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Regulatory Inaction in India</h2>
            <p>Despite global bans, <span class="highlight">ranitidine continues to be manufactured and sold in India</span>. The Ministry of Health has failed to take concrete action, leaving Indian lives at risk. Key questions arise:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why did Indian regulators fail to detect impurities in ranitidine, widely consumed across the country?</li>
                <li>Why hasn’t India acted like its Western counterparts to ban ranitidine, given the availability of safer alternatives like famotidine and omeprazole?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- The Role of Regulatory Bodies -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">The Role of Regulatory Bodies</h2>
            <p>India’s regulatory framework involves multiple agencies, each with distinct responsibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC):</strong> Responsible for setting quality standards and testing protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>State Drug Controllers:</strong> Issue manufacturing licenses for drugs.</li>
                <li><strong>Drug Inspectors:</strong> Conduct market sampling to ensure compliance with IPC standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, systemic inefficiencies have prevented effective action. For instance, the IPC has yet to define permissible NDMA limits for ranitidine, even though global guidelines exist.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- The Need for Immediate Action -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">The Need for Immediate Action</h2>
            <p>The Ministry of Health, empowered by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, must prohibit the manufacture and sale of ranitidine. The Ministry's inaction reflects broader governance challenges, including technical incompetence and bureaucratic inertia.</p>
            <p>India must follow global best practices and prioritize public health by immediately banning ranitidine. Regulatory agencies should also enhance surveillance mechanisms to prevent similar lapses in the future.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2 class="subheading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Continued ranitidine use in India highlights glaring regulatory gaps and government apathy. With safer alternatives available, there is no justification for allowing a drug linked to cancer risks to remain on the market. The Ministry of Health must act decisively to safeguard public health and restore trust in India’s drug regulatory framework.</p>
            <p>As Nelson Mandela once said, “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.” Similarly, the health and safety of citizens should be a top priority for any responsible government.</p>
