        Air Quality Index (AQI) and its Impact on Children’s Education
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The increasing air pollution levels across the globe have become a serious concern, especially in urban centers. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a critical indicator of pollution levels, but the thresholds for harmful exposure and their impacts on children have often been overlooked. This article delves into the connection between AQI levels and their repercussions on children’s health and education, highlighting the need for a child-centric policy approach.</p>

        <h2>Understanding AQI Thresholds and Its Impacts</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>What AQI Levels Mean</h3>
            <p>While harmful effects of air pollution start at <span class="highlight">AQI > 50</span>, the public discourse and policies tend to focus on severe levels (AQI > 400). This normalizes ongoing health risks, especially for children, who are more vulnerable to long-term damage caused by exposure to poor air quality.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Impact on Children</h3>
        <p>Children are particularly susceptible to the effects of air pollution due to their developing lungs and immune systems. Studies show that air quality at schools and homes is often similar, meaning children face constant exposure regardless of where they are. This exposure not only leads to respiratory issues but also affects cognitive development and overall well-being.</p>

        <h2>Challenges in Addressing AQI Impacts on Education</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <p>School closures, as a response to high AQI levels, have unintended consequences. For underprivileged children, schools provide not only education but also mid-day meals and social interaction. Prolonged closures disrupt learning and lead to nutritional deficiencies.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Problems with Online Learning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Online classes cannot replace the holistic development offered by physical learning environments.</li>
            <li>Increased screen exposure negatively impacts young children, affecting their eyesight and mental health.</li>
            <li>Lack of resources like stable internet connections disproportionately harms underprivileged students.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mask Mandates and Air Purifiers</h3>
        <p>The blanket use of face masks, especially for children under 12, lacks sufficient scientific backing. Additionally, masks become redundant in environments with air purifiers. There is a need for personalized mask usage based on medical advice rather than uniform mandates.</p>

        <h2>Recommendations for a Balanced Approach</h2>
        <h3>Keeping Schools Open</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Schools should remain open with restricted outdoor activities during poor AQI days.</li>
            <li>Sealed classrooms and air purifiers can help maintain indoor air quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Encouraging Physical Learning</h3>
        <p>Hybrid or online learning models should be discouraged in favor of in-person classes, as physical interaction is crucial for children's development. Policies should also ensure access to mid-day meals for underprivileged students during high pollution periods.</p>

        <h3>Health Support Measures</h3>
        <p>Regular health checkups and vaccinations should be prioritized for vulnerable groups to mitigate the long-term effects of air pollution.</p>

        <h2>Policy Perspectives</h2>
        <p>The current policy framework, including the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), often disproportionately affects underprivileged communities. A more nuanced, scientifically informed approach is needed to delink school closures from AQI-based triggers and instead focus on solutions that prioritize children’s well-being and education.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>Air pollution is a pressing issue, and its impact on children’s education demands urgent attention. Blanket measures like school closures are not a sustainable solution. Instead, policies must adopt a child-centric approach, ensuring safe learning environments, personalized health measures, and equitable access to education. A proactive, balanced strategy will not only safeguard children’s health but also secure their future.</p>
