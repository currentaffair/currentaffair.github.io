        Growing Internal Security Challenges Amid the Russia-Ukraine War
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, now in its third year, has shifted the global focus, overshadowing other forms of violence, including those perpetrated by extremist groups. As the war continues, internal security challenges, especially militancy, have become more complex. This article explores the growing security challenges and suggests key measures to counter militancy tendencies.</p>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>The Russia-Ukraine war has drawn global attention, but it has also caused the rise of extremist violence in other regions to be sidelined. With an increase in domestic extremist activities, countries must reframe their focus on internal security, especially in light of evolving challenges posed by militant ideologies.</p>

        <h3>RAND STUDY</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Title:</em> “<strong>Changing Face of Hate: Domestic Extremist Violence</strong>”</li>
            <li>The study highlights significant changes within extremist groups worldwide, including the rise of right-wing extremism.</li>
            <li>It emphasized the need for law enforcement agencies to understand these evolving threats to effectively counter them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>India’s Post-Independence Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In the early years of independence, India faced <strong>communal violence</strong> and <strong>communist movements</strong>, notably the Tebhaga and Telangana uprisings, both of which were unsuccessful but marked significant chapters in India's internal security landscape.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>20th Century: The Naxalite Movement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Naxalite Movement, originally intended to promote a left-wing revival, escalated into widespread violence during its peak, affecting regions like <strong>West Bengal</strong>, <strong>Andhra Pradesh</strong>, and <strong>Kerala</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Right-Wing Spread</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Many countries, particularly in Europe, have seen a rise in <strong>xenophobic</strong> sentiments, with countries like <strong>Germany</strong> grappling with growing right-wing extremism.</li>
            <li>The political shift to the right in <strong>France</strong> and the <strong>Brexit referendum</strong> of 2016 serve as indicators of broader global trends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Right-Wing Extremism in the West</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Post-2001, there has been a notable increase in right-wing extremist sympathies in the West, exacerbated by the spread of <strong>misinformation</strong> and the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Law Enforcement’s Role</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Law enforcement agencies must enhance their focus on the rising threat of terrorist and extremist modules.</li>
            <li>Protests in India have arisen in response to actions taken against extremist groups, highlighting the tension between security measures and civil liberties.</li>
            <li>Understanding right-wing tendencies within various societal sections is crucial for preventing the spread of extremism.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The growing challenges to internal security demand a nuanced approach, including intelligence gathering, counterterrorism strategies, and a focus on combating the root causes of extremism. Key measures to counter militancy should include enhancing law enforcement capabilities, promoting community cohesion, and addressing the social and economic factors that breed extremism.</p>
