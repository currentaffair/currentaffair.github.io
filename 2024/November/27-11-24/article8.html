        <h3>Professor G.N. Saibaba’s Case:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Saibaba, a <strong>quadriplegic</strong>, was imprisoned in 2014 despite a lack of concrete evidence.</li>
            <li>Experienced <strong>severe</strong> <strong>neglect</strong> at Nagpur Central Jail, including inadequate wheelchair accessibility and cramped “<strong>anda cell.</strong></li>
            <li>Faced daily challenges with basic tasks like using the toilet, fetching water, and bathing.</li>
            <li>Exonerated in 2024, but died shortly after, highlighting the toll of neglect.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>General Conditions in Indian Prisons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Indian prisons are <strong>overcrowded</strong>, with over <strong>5.73</strong> lakh prisoners, exceeding their capacity of <strong>4.36</strong> lakh.</li>
            <li>Chronic issues of <strong>violence</strong>, <strong>abuse</strong>, and <strong>neglect</strong> persist in prisons.</li>
            <li>Prisoners with disabilities are more vulnerable to abuse from both staff and other inmates.</li>
            <li>Special needs for prisoners with disabilities are largely ignored or unmet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Father Stan Swamy’s Case:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Father</strong> <strong>Swamy</strong>, with <strong>Parkinson’s</strong> <strong>disease</strong>, was denied basic assistive items like a <strong>straw</strong> and <strong>sipper</strong> while imprisoned.</li>
            <li>This denial of basic care violated his legal rights under the <strong>Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016).</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Accessibility Issues in Prisons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A 2018 audit of Delhi’s prisons revealed gaps such as <strong>unfunctional wheelchairs</strong>, inaccessible cells, and limited access to essential facilities.</li>
            <li>The lack of accessible toilets, mulaqat rooms, and recreational spaces further exacerbates the challenges for prisoners with disabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legal Framework and Rights:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Constitution guarantees prisoners’ rights to equality, liberty, and dignity.</li>
            <li>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities prohibits torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners with disabilities.</li>
            <li>India’s <strong>Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016)</strong> and the <strong>Model Prison Manual (2016)</strong> outline the need for accessible prison facilities.</li>
            <li>Despite these legal frameworks, enforcement remains weak, and prisoners with disabilities continue to suffer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Political and Public Indifference:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Many people believe prisoners deserve their suffering, fostering public indifference and a lack of political will for reform.</li>
            <li>The government’s failure to prioritize prison reforms undermines the legal protections for prisoners with disabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Way Forward:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate reforms</strong> are needed to ensure accessible and dignified conditions for prisoners with disabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>State governments</strong> must take <strong>responsibility</strong> for ensuring legal protections and accommodating prisoners with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Stronger enforcement of existing laws and policies is essential to prevent further abuse and neglect.</li>
        </ul>
