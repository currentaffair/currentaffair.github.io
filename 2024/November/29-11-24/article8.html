<header>From Armed Insurgencies to Democratic Politics: An Evolution</header>

<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Integrating insurgent groups into democratic politics is a remarkable phenomenon that strengthens the legitimacy of democracy itself. The electoral success of Sri Lanka’s Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People’s Power in recent elections symbolizes the transformative journey of revolutionary groups transitioning from armed struggles to democratic participation. Such shifts, historically rooted in ideologies like Marxism-Leninism and Maoism, offer critical lessons about adaptability, pragmatism, and the enduring relevance of democratic processes.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Origins and Ideologies of Left-Wing Insurgencies</h3>
    <p>Left-wing insurgencies typically arise from dissatisfaction with systemic injustices. Armed struggle is often justified as the only means to dismantle structures perceived as oppressive and biased toward elite interests. Groups in <span class="highlight">El Salvador, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka</span> have historically adhered to principles like "protracted people's war," believing that social and economic justice necessitates revolutionary overthrow.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Challenges of Prolonged Insurgencies</h3>
    <p>Prolonged insurgencies demand immense resources, unwavering popular support, and resilience against state counterinsurgency measures. Over time, civilian casualties, economic hardship, and shifting public sentiment force insurgent groups to reevaluate armed struggles.</p>
    <p>In many cases, <span class="highlight">political engagement becomes a viable alternative</span>, offering a path to achieve their goals with broader public support and fewer costs.</p>
  </section>

    <h3>Case Studies: Notable Transitions</h3>
    <h4>Nepal</h4>
    <p>The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) initiated a civil war in 1996 to dismantle the monarchy. After a decade of conflict, the group signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, transitioning to mainstream politics. By 2008, Nepal became a federal democratic republic under their leadership, showcasing how revolutionary ideals can be adapted to democratic frameworks.</p>

    <h4>El Salvador</h4>
    <p>The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) fought a civil war during the 1980s to overthrow a U.S.-backed regime. Following the 1992 peace accords, the FMLN transitioned to a political party and later won national elections. Their journey exemplifies the evolution from revolutionary Marxism to democratic socialism.</p>

    <h4>India</h4>
    <p>While the Communist Party of India (Maoist) continues armed insurgency, other factions, such as the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, have embraced democratic participation. By the 1980s, the latter contested elections, demonstrating that electoral politics could advance revolutionary agendas.</p>

    <h3>Factors Driving the Shift</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strategic Realism:</strong> Armed struggles are unsustainable in the long term. Negotiated peace accords, such as in Nepal and El Salvador, offer an alternative path.</li>
      <li><strong>Public Sentiment:</strong> Prolonged violence alienates civilians, weakening insurgents’ support bases.</li>
      <li><strong>International Pressure:</strong> Global condemnation of violent insurgencies and mediation efforts, such as those by the UN, encourage peaceful transitions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h3>Analysis: Adaptation vs. Ideological Compromise</h3>
    <p>For insurgent groups, adapting revolutionary doctrines to democratic frameworks often sparks debate about ideological compromise. While some argue this shift dilutes revolutionary ideals, others view it as an evolution—a reimagining of struggle within modern realities. By engaging in mainstream politics, these groups amplify marginalized voices and promote inclusive governance.</p>

    <h3>Impact on Democracy</h3>
    <p>Incorporating insurgent groups into democratic politics strengthens democratic institutions by diversifying representation. Their participation fosters resilience and inclusivity, particularly when they remain committed to democratic norms. However, challenges persist, such as overcoming public skepticism about their violent pasts and balancing idealism with governance demands.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This transition from armed insurrection to political participation redefines contemporary insurgencies, proving that radical movements can evolve within democratic frameworks. By adapting their ideologies, these groups demonstrate that democracy remains a dynamic and resilient system capable of addressing systemic injustices through inclusive participation.</p>
