        <h1>The JEE System: Challenges and Solutions</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is one of India's most competitive academic tests, serving as the gateway to prestigious engineering institutes like the IITs. However, the current system has faced criticism for its lack of inclusivity, high costs, and its impact on students' well-being. This article explores the challenges in the JEE system and proposes actionable solutions to ensure a more equitable and effective framework.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges in the Current JEE System</h2>
        <h3>Loss of Childhood and Burnout</h3>
        <p>JEE aspirants often dedicate years to intense preparation, sacrificing their childhood and extracurricular pursuits. The demanding nature of the exam leaves many students burnt out before they even enter college.</p>

        <h3>Exclusivity and Low Success Rate</h3>
        <p>Only <span class="highlight">2% of aspirants</span> succeed in securing admission, making it an incredibly exclusive process. Success often feels like winning a lottery rather than a reflection of true potential.</p>

        <h3>High Cost of Preparation</h3>
        <p>Coaching institutes, while improving chances of success, come with exorbitant fees, placing immense financial strain on families. Students from lower economic strata often bear significant hardships, with no guarantee of success despite their investment.</p>

        <h3>Mental Health Concerns</h3>
        <p>Failure to meet expectations can lead to feelings of guilt and depression, sometimes escalating to extreme cases of suicidal tendencies.</p>

        <h3>Limited Relevance of the Curriculum</h3>
        <p>The knowledge gained during JEE preparation often lacks practical application in real-world engineering. According to <span class="highlight">McKinsey reports</span>, a significant proportion of Indian engineering graduates are unemployable due to skill gaps.</p>

        <h3>Restricted Academic Choice</h3>
        <p>Many students are compelled to pursue engineering branches they are not passionate about, leading to dissatisfaction and reduced academic engagement.</p>

        <h2>Women in Engineering</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>According to the <span class="highlight">All-India Survey on Higher Education (2021-22)</span>, women constitute only 29% of engineering students, reflecting systemic gender disparities. While a 20% quota for women in IITs has improved representation, much work remains to address this imbalance.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Proposed Reforms</h2>
        <h3>Mentoring-Based Education System</h3>
        <p>A new mentoring approach can redefine the JEE process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Top institutions like IITs and NITs should focus on mentoring third and fourth-year students.</li>
            <li>Entrance exams for mentoring institutions should occur after the second year of engineering education.</li>
            <li>First and second-year students can follow a curriculum based on <span class="highlight">NPTEL courses</span>, which are accessible and standardized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Enhancing NPTEL and Free Online Resources</h3>
        <p>The National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) should be expanded:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide free, high-quality courses in local languages.</li>
            <li>Offer online doubt-clearing sessions conducted by IIT faculty.</li>
            <li>Enable students to continue using NPTEL courses for skill enhancement, even if they do not gain admission to top mentoring institutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rewarding Institutions and Coaching Centers</h3>
        <p>High-performing colleges and coaching centers should be incentivized:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Promote colleges that consistently send students to mentoring institutions.</li>
            <li>Provide autonomy to well-performing institutions, allowing them to set their tuition fees and innovate academically.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion">
            The JEE system, while prestigious, needs a transformative approach to address its limitations. By shifting towards a mentoring-based model, expanding accessible resources like NPTEL, and incentivizing high-performing institutions, India can ensure a more inclusive, equitable, and effective engineering education system. Reforming JEE is essential not only for individual success but also for the nation's industrial and technological growth.
