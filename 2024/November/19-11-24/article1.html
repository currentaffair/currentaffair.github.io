        <p><strong>Context</strong>: A fire in the neonatal unit of Jhansi’s Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College on November 15, 2023, killed 10 newborns due to an electrical short-circuit and overcrowded conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance</strong>: GS 2 (Health)</p>
        <p><strong><em>Practice Question:</em></strong><em> Discuss the importance of fire safety in healthcare buildings and suggest key measures to prevent tragedies like the one in Jhansi. (250 words)</em></p>

        <h3>Neglect of Fire Safety and Healthcare</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The tragedy highlights the fatal consequences of <strong>neglecting fire safety</strong> and <strong>healthcare</strong> in government planning and budgeting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Overcrowding in Neonatal Care</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The neonatal intensive care unit was operating at nearly <strong>three times its capacity</strong>, with 49 babies for incubators meant for 18, reflecting <strong>poor infrastructure</strong> and resource management in the healthcare system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Healthcare System Strain</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The doctor-patient ratio</strong> in Uttar Pradesh (1:2,158) is well below the <strong>WHO standard</strong> (1:1,000), showing a severe <strong>shortage of medical professionals</strong> and contributing to poor healthcare delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hospital’s Poor Infrastructure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College</strong> has dilapidated facilities despite serving <strong>Bundelkhand</strong>, a region with limited healthcare access, indicating <strong>chronic underinvestment</strong> in public health infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fire Safety Failures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Preliminary reports suggest <strong>electrical short-circuit</strong> as the cause of the fire, exacerbated by oxygen cylinders. This points to the <strong>failure to meet fire safety norms</strong>, as <strong>short-circuit-induced fires</strong> are common in Uttar Pradesh.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chronic Underfunding of Public Health</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>allocation for healthcare</strong> in the Union Budget (2.2% in FY2022, 1.75% in FY2023) is far below the global average and significantly lower than peer countries like <strong>Brazil</strong> and <strong>South Africa</strong>, which allocate a much higher percentage of their GDP to healthcare.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lack of Fire Services and Infrastructure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>India’s <strong>fire safety services</strong> are underdeveloped, with <strong>insufficient coverage</strong> and response capacity, contributing to the frequency of such tragedies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Broader Indifference</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The tragedy is not just a failure of the Jhansi hospital, but a <strong>broader systemic issue</strong> involving <strong>indifference to public health</strong> and <strong>fire safety</strong>, leading to preventable deaths and infrastructure collapse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>A combination of overcrowded healthcare facilities, poor infrastructure, insufficient funding, and failure to enforce fire safety regulations led to the Jhansi tragedy. Steps need to be taken to ensure safety.</p>
