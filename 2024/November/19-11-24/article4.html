        <h3>Article 356 and the Failure of State Machinery</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Manipur violence has been ongoing since May 2023, showing a law and order breakdown, suggesting Article 356 intervention.</li>
            <li>Between May 3 and November 11, 2024, more than 250 people were killed and over a lakh people were displaced from their homes in the ethnic violence.</li>
            <li>Article 356 allows the President of India to take over a state’s administration if it can’t function according to the Constitution.</li>
            <li>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar argued that Article 356 was necessary for such emergencies when the state government fails.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Relevance</strong>: GS 2 (Polity), GS 3 (Internal Security)</p>
        <p><strong><em>Practice Question</em></strong><em>: Explain the Manipur crisis and discuss how Article 356 can act as a potential solution. (150 marks)</em></p>
        
        <h3>Why Manipur’s Situation is Unique</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlike other regions like Nagaland or Jammu & Kashmir, violence in Manipur involves ordinary civilians, not just insurgents.</li>
            <li>Common people acting as both victims and forced participants in the violence, which is unusual compared to typical insurgencies.</li>
            <li>The government’s hesitation to act efficiently has drawn criticism for not prioritising peace and stability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Constituent Assembly Views on Article 356</h3>
        <h4>Support:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar</strong>: It is the duty of the central government to step in if a state’s Constitution fails.</li>
            <li><strong>K. Santhanam:</strong> Article 356 is crucial to prevent chaos during state breakdowns.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Opposition:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>H.V. Kamath:</strong> Called it a <strong>“constitutional crime,”</strong> warning it could lead to excessive central interference.</li>
            <li>Despite the debates, the Article was included to address severe emergencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Role of the Supreme Court and Its Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In May 2023, the Supreme Court ordered the government to restore peace, but violence continued despite multiple hearings.</li>
            <li>July 2023 saw the Court express deep concern over a high-profile incident involving women, highlighting the failure to protect fundamental rights.</li>
            <li>The ongoing violence suggests a gap between judicial directives and actual enforcement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Need for Immediate Presidential Intervention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dr. Ambedkar emphasised the Centre’s responsibility when a state’s governance collapses.</li>
            <li>Presidential intervention is a potential step to stop further violence and restore constitutional order.</li>
        </ul>
