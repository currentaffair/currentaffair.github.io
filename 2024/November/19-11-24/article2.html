        <p><strong><em>Practice Question:</em></strong><em> Discuss the implications of major news organizations like The Guardian leaving social media platforms like X in the Indian context. (150 words)</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who is The Guardian?</strong>: The Guardian is a well-known British newspaper with a long history of journalism.</li>
            <li><strong>Why They Left:</strong> They decided to leave X (formerly Twitter) because of the disturbing content on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact of U.S. Election:</strong> The U.S. presidential election campaign highlighted the platform’s toxicity and its influence on political discourse.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Alone:</strong> Other major news organizations like NPR and PBS also left X in 2023, protesting the platform’s labelling of them as “government-funded media.”</li>
            <li><strong>CCDH’s Concerns:</strong> The Center for Countering Digital Hate left X due to concerns about the platform’s revised terms of service. These changes could potentially hinder the organization’s ability to fight legal battles against harmful content.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Strain on Legacy Media:</strong> Traditional media outlets are facing financial difficulties, while social media platforms continue to grow.</li>
            <li><strong>The Importance of Reliable Information:</strong> Accurate information is crucial for a healthy democracy. Legacy media plays a vital role in providing credible news, while social media often spreads misinformation.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact of X on Mainstream Media:</strong> A study by Julia Cagé suggests that X can influence mainstream media, potentially leading to biased or inaccurate reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>A Step Towards Accountability:</strong> The Guardian’s decision to leave X could be a positive step towards restoring accountability and promoting a more responsible information ecosystem.</li>
