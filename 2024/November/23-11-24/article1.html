        Poverty and Climate Change: The Role of the Global South in the Battle
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Poverty and climate change are deeply intertwined, with the poorest communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. These communities, particularly in the Global South, face an uphill battle in addressing both poverty and the consequences of environmental degradation. Global efforts to tackle these issues have often been diluted by geopolitical tensions, leading to a need for more focused and inclusive action.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h3>Focus on Poverty and Climate Justice</h3>
            <p>The summit aimed to address global hunger, poverty, and promote climate justice. The connection between poverty and climate change is undeniable, as those suffering from poverty are often the ones most affected by environmental crises.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brazilian President’s Proposal:</strong> Lula Da Silva suggested taxing the "super-rich" with a 2% wealth tax to generate significant revenue ($200 billion) for climate justice, although this measure was not adopted in the G-20 declaration.</li>
                <li><strong>India’s Standpoint:</strong> Prime Minister Modi emphasized the disproportionate impact of global issues on the Global South, advocating for greater representation of developing countries in global governance.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h3>Outcomes and Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>G-20 Declarations:</strong> The summit expressed concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza but lacked concrete measures, particularly in addressing conflicts like Israel-Gaza and Russia-Ukraine.</li>
                <li><strong>Diluted Focus:</strong> The timing of the summit, coinciding with other geopolitical crises, diluted the focus on poverty and climate change.</li>
                <li><strong>COP29 Influence:</strong> Efforts to align the G-20 with COP29 on climate issues were overshadowed by geopolitical tensions, weakening the potential for coordinated climate action.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h3>Implications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geopolitical Tensions:</strong> Polarization due to the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war made it difficult to reach a consensus, diminishing the effectiveness of the G-20 declaration on poverty and climate change.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Justice:</strong> There is a pressing need for developed nations, particularly the U.S., to commit more significantly to climate action. The potential future leadership of the U.S. under Donald Trump raises concerns about less emphasis on climate policies, which could undermine efforts to help the Global South.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section highlight">
            <h3>Moving Forward: The Role of the Global South</h3>
            <p>The next G-20 summit in South Africa and subsequent forums must prioritize the concerns of the developing world and set clear, actionable paths to address poverty, hunger, and climate change.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global South’s Role:</strong> The developing world must continue to push for greater representation and action in tackling poverty and climate issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Urgent Action Required:</strong> As the G-20 will return to the U.S. in 2026, the Global South must ensure their priorities are not sidelined, ensuring substantial progress in the interim.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="footer">
            <p>Conclusion: The Global South plays a pivotal role in the fight against poverty and climate change. While geopolitical tensions pose a significant challenge, it is crucial for developing nations to continue advocating for climate justice and sustainable development to protect the most vulnerable communities.</p>
