For example, they can invoke Bangladesh’s Foreign Private Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act.</strong></li><li>However, relying on the host state’s domestic law has its limitations, as the state can unilaterally change these laws to the detriment of the investor at any time.</li><li>Similarly, contracts may offer limited protection when challenging sovereign actions by the state that adversely affect foreign investments.</li><li>Consequently, the third legal framework, international law, becomes particularly important in such situations.</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">The India-Bangladesh BIT:</h4><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>International law cannot be unilaterally altered and serves as a mechanism to hold states accountable for their sovereign actions.</li><li>In the realm of foreign investment protection, the most critical tool in international law is the bilateral investment treaty (BIT).</li><li>A BIT is an agreement between two countries designed to safeguard investments made by investors from both nations.</li><li>These treaties protect investments by setting conditions on the regulatory actions of the host state, thus preventing undue interference with the rights of foreign investors.</li><li>Key provisions in BITs include restrictions on unlawful expropriation, obligations for the host state to provide fair and equitable treatment (FET) to foreign investments, and non-discrimination against foreign investors.</li><li><strong>BITs also grant foreign investors the right to directly sue the host state before an international tribunal if they believe the host state has violated its treaty obligations, a process known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS).</strong></li><li>According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), by the end of 2023, 1,332 known ISDS claims had been brought.</li><li>In the event of adverse regulatory actions by the Bangladeshi government, Indian companies can rely on the India-Bangladesh BIT, which was signed in 2009.</li><li>Although India has unilaterally terminated most of its BITs, the one with Bangladesh remains in effect.</li><li>This treaty includes comprehensive investment protection measures, such as an unqualified FET provision, which could be beneficial for Indian companies challenging Bangladesh’s sovereign regulatory actions.</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Complication- Joint Interpretative Notes (JIN):</h4><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>However, there is a complication: the Joint Interpretative Notes (JIN) that India and Bangladesh adopted in 2017 to clarify the meaning of various terms in the 2009 treaty.</li><li><strong>This JIN, now part of the BIT, was introduced at India’s insistence as part of its broader effort to revise its investment treaty practices to protect its regulatory authority.</strong></li><li>India proposed similar JINs to several other countries, without fully considering whether it had a defensive or offensive interest in relation to each specific country. The JIN has diluted the investment protection features of the BIT.</li><li>For example, taxation measures are excluded from the treaty’s scope. Similarly, the FET provision is tied to customary international law, which imposes a higher standard for proving a treaty violation.</li><li><strong>The JIN was crafted from the perspective of a capital-importing country to protect its regulatory actions from ISDS claims.</strong></li><li>In the case of India and Bangladesh, however, India is the capital exporter and Bangladesh the importer.</li><li>Ironically, the JIN that India developed could end up benefiting Bangladesh rather than the Indian companies operating there.</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion:</h4><p>While Bangladesh is the immediate focus, the issue extends beyond India’s eastern neighbor. India’s outbound investments have significantly increased, with outward foreign direct investment reaching approximately $13.5 billion in 2023, according to . India is now among the top 20 capital-exporting countries. This growth underscores the importance of legal protection for Indian companies operating abroad. Consequently, India needs to develop its investment treaty practices by considering both its role as a host and as a home country, rather than focusing solely on the former.</p>
