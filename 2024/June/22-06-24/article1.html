        <h1>Heatwave Could Severely Impact the Economy</h1>
        <h2>Context:</h2>
        <p>The intense heat waves sweeping across the country, particularly in Northern India, have pushed temperatures to over 52 degrees Celsius in Delhi and Rajasthan, marking the season’s highest temperatures and resulting in a few suspected heat-related deaths.</p>
        
        <h2>Relevance:</h2>
        <p><strong>GS3- Disaster Management</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Mains Question:</h2>
        <p>The ongoing scorching heat could undermine economic activity and underscores the critical need for climate-responsive action to safeguard both people and productivity. Analyse. (15 Marks, 250 Words).</p>
        
        <h2>Heatwaves across Indian States:</h2>
        <p>Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh are also grappling with heat waves. The situation is expected to worsen as the predicts temperatures in northwest India will nearly reach 50 degrees Celsius, endangering millions of workers in farming, construction, and industrial sectors, and causing widespread distress.</p>
        <p>This presents a significant threat to productivity in many economies, highlighting the urgent need for a climate-responsive action plan.</p>
        
        <h2>Effect of Heatwaves on Economy:</h2>
        <p>According to a report, rising temperatures due to climate change are a growing concern in India, with each year experiencing higher temperatures. By 2030, over 160-200 million people across the country could be exposed to deadly heat annually. Additionally, about 34 million people in India may face job losses due to productivity declines related to heat stress.</p>
        <p>The impacts of rising temperatures vary across different occupations and employment sectors. Jobs requiring high levels of physical exertion or extended outdoor work are particularly vulnerable to increasing heat. Specifically, agricultural and construction jobs, as well as work in steel plants and brick kilns, are expected to be the hardest hit.</p>
        <p>According to a study, in 1995, heat stress caused a loss of 5.87% of working hours in agriculture and construction, 2.95% in industry, and 0.63% in services in India. By 2030, these losses are expected to rise to 9.04% in agriculture and construction, 5.29% in industry, and 1.48% in services.</p>
        <p>Heat stress is increasingly hindering economic activities, reducing the ability of businesses to operate during peak heat hours, and further temperature increases are expected to decrease labor productivity. This could make some agricultural areas unproductive and displace many farm workers. Global economic losses from heat stress at work were estimated at US$280 billion in 1995 and are projected to rise to US$2,400 billion by 2030. Currently, annual food losses due to heat during transportation are nearly $13 billion. By 2037, the demand for cooling is likely to be eight times higher than current levels, equating to a new air conditioner being needed every 15 seconds and resulting in a projected 435% increase in annual greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades.</p>
        <p>To address this challenge, India must implement new strategic sustainable solutions to help people adapt to rising temperatures.</p>
        
        <h2>Way Forward:</h2>
        <p>The World Bank study, “Climate Investment Opportunities in India’s Cooling Sector,” highlights that adopting alternative and innovative energy-efficient technologies is crucial to tackling the heat wave crisis. This strategy could open up an investment opportunity of $1.6 trillion by 2040, significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create nearly 3.7 million jobs.</p>
        <p>The study strongly suggests that a more energy-efficient approach could significantly reduce CO2 levels over the next two decades. By implementing a comprehensive cooling strategy, India can save lives and livelihoods, cut carbon emissions, and establish itself as a global leader in green cooling manufacturing. The report outlines a sustainable roadmap for cooling that could effectively cut 300 million tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2040.</p>
        <p>In 2019, India launched initiatives to promote sustainable cooling measures across various sectors. These measures include indoor cooling for buildings, solar refrigeration for the agriculture and pharmaceuticals sectors, and air-conditioning for passenger transport. The plan aims to reduce electricity-driven cooling demand by up to 25 percent by 2037-38, potentially creating 2 million jobs for trained technicians and decreasing refrigerant demand by about 31 percent over the next two decades.</p>
        <p>Adopting climate-responsive cooling techniques is essential to ensure that rising temperatures do not disproportionately affect those at the bottom of the economic ladder. The report advocates for incorporating these techniques into India’s affordable housing program, which could benefit over 11 million urban homes and more than 29 million rural houses planned by the government.</p>
        <p>Public-private investments in district-level cooling technologies are crucial. These advanced systems produce chilled water in a central plant and distribute it to multiple buildings through underground insulated pipes, drastically reducing individual building cooling costs and cutting electricity bills by 20-30 percent compared to the most efficient conventional solutions. The Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA) office in Chandigarh is a prime example of a climate-responsive building, providing cooling in summer and warmth in winter. This model can be widely replicated in future green building projects.</p>
        <p>To combat rising food and pharmaceutical waste during transportation due to higher temperatures, the World Bank report recommends addressing gaps in cold chain distribution networks. Investments in pre-cooling and refrigerated transport can significantly reduce food loss by about 76 percent and lower carbon emissions by 16 percent.</p>
        <p>India is determined to phase out the production and use of ozone-depleting hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which are used as coolants in air conditioners and refrigerators. The report emphasizes the need to improve the servicing, maintenance, and disposal of equipment using these substances, and to swiftly transition to alternatives with a lower global warming impact. Understanding the impact of climate change on the workplace, especially for the most affected and vulnerable populations, is essential.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>The World Bank report strongly recommends accelerating the structural transformation of rural economies by promoting the growth of responsible and sustainable, or “green,” businesses. This approach will decrease the exposure of agricultural workers to extreme temperatures and reduce the need for physical labor in such conditions. Other critical policy measures include developing skills, creating an environment conducive to sustainable enterprises, and making significant public investments in infrastructure to address the climate crisis.</p>
